  14    4: Useful commands:
  15    4: 
  16    4:    The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
  17    4: for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
  18    4: printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
  19    4: command restores long descriptions.
  20    4:    The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
  21    4: of what the game is about.
  22    4:    The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
  23    4: to continue playing.
  24    4:    The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
  25    4:    The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
  26    4:    The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
  27    4:    The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
  28    4:    The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
  29    4:    The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
  30    4:    The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
  31    4: 
  32    4: Command abbreviations:
  33    4: 
  34    4:    The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
  35    4:    The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
  36    4:    The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
  37    4: 
  38    4: Containment:
  39    4: 
  40    4:    Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
  41    4: be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
  42    4: not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
  43    4: which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
  44    4: to see such an object, the container must be either open or
  45    4: transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
  46    4: the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
  47    4: sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
  48    4: in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
  49    4: will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
  50    4: process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
  51    4: can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
  52    4: one level down.
  53    4: 
  54    4: Fighting:
  55    4: 
  56    4:    Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
  57    4: attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
  58    4: Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
  59    4: etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
  60    4: fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
  61    4: getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
  62    4: Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
  63    4: fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
  64    4: should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
  65    4: 
  66    4: Command parser:
  67    4: 
  68    4:    A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
  69    4: For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
  70    4: first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
  71    4: 'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
  72    4: creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
  73    4: tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
  74    4: 
  75    4:    You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
  76    4: the following types of things--
  77    4: 
  78    4:    Actions:
  79    4:  Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
  80    4:  Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
  81    4:  PUT DOWN, etc.
  82    4: 
  83    4:    Directions:
  84    4:  NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
  85    4:  Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
  86    4:  only certain situations.
  87    4: 
  88    4:    Objects:
  89    4:  Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
  90    4: 
  91    4:    Adjectives:
  92    4:  Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
  93    4:  two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
  94    4:  DOORs, BUTTONs).
  95    4: 
  96    4:    Prepositions:
  97    4:  It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
  98    4:  the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
  99    4:  without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
 100    4:  CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
 101    4:  When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
 102    4:  WITH DEMON' won't parse.
 103    4: 
 104    4:    Sentences:
 105    4:  The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
 106    4:  tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
 107    4:  can be placed on the same line.
 108    4: 
 109    4:    Ambiguity:
 110    4:  The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
 111    4:  actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
 112    4:  If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
 113    4:  that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
 114    4:  Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
 115    5: Welcome to Dungeon!
 116    5: 
 117    5:    You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
 118    5: quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
 119    5: In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
 120    5: receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
 121    5: case in the living room of the house.
 122    5: 
 123    5:    In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
 124    5: which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
 125    5: need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
 126    5: since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
 127    5: material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
 128    5: is rumored to be useful.
 129    5: 
 130    5:    To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
 131    5: When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
 132    5: certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
 133    5: the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
 134    5: safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
 135    5: addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
 136    5: with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
 137    5: which you may do only twice.
 138    5: 
 139    5:    Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
 140    5: likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
 141    5: light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
 142    5: rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
 143    5: you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
 144    5: he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
 145    5: his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
 146    5: ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
 147    5: through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
 148    6: Please answer the question.
 149    7: You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
 150    7: dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
 151    7: installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
 152    7: may gloat over them.
 153    8: What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
 154    8: RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
 155    9: Now let me see...
 156    9: Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
 157    9: everything.
 158   10: Do you wish me to try to patch you?
 159   11: You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
 160   11: there is a window which is #.
 161   12: open
 162   13: slightly ajar
 163   14: You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
 164   14: been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
 165   14: the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
 166   14: east is a small window which is #.
 167   15: You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
 168   15: is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
 169   15: nailed shut.
 170   16: You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
 171   16: is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
 172   16: strange gothic lettering.
 173   17: In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
 174   18: In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
 175   19: In the center of the room is an open trap door.
 176   20: There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
 177   21: You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
 178   21: east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
 179   21: steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
 180   22: The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
 181   23: You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
 182   23: passages in the immediate vicinity.
 183   24: Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
 184   25: Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
 185   26: Above you is a grating.
 186   27: You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
 187   27: and south.
 188   28: There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
 189   29: There is an open grating descending into darkness.
 190   30: A grating appears on the ground.
 191   31: You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
 192   32: You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
 193   32: reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
 194   32: a wide stream running through the center of the room.
 195   33: There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
 196   33: climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
 197   34: You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
 198   34: Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
 199   34: cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
 200   35: You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
 201   35: large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
 202   36: You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
 203   37: You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
 204   37: a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
 205   37: a wide stream running through the center of the room.
 206   38: There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
 207   39: You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
 208   39: and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
 209   40: Part of the glacier has been melted.
 210   41: There is a large passageway leading westward.
 211   42: You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
 212   42: on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
 213   42: an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
 214   43: Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
 215   43: actions.
 216   44:   BOOOOOOOOOM
 217   45: You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
 218   45: corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
 219   45: dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
 220   45: obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
 221   45: label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
 222   45: ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
 223   45: inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
 224   46: closed
 225   47: The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
 226   48: You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
 227   49: In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
 228   49: is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
 229   50: A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
 230   50: from the ceiling and lifts you away...
 231   51: You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
 232   51: of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
 233   51: wooden railing which circles the dome.
 234   52: Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
 235   52: from the floor below.
 236   53: I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
 237   54: You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
 238   54: staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
 239   54: large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
 240   54: around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
 241   54: center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
 242   55: A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
 243   55: five feet above your head.
 244   56: You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
 245   57: Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
 246   58: According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
 247   58: fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
 248   58: I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
 249   59: You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
 250   59: 
 251   59:  "Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
 252   59: 
 253   59: The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
 254   59: mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
 255   59: hideous fate, can be heard.
 256   60: The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
 257   60: attempts to pass.
 258   61: There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
 259   61: cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
 260   61: are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
 261   62: You are not equipped for an exorcism.
 262   63: There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
 263   63: cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
 264   63: of a greater power, flee through the walls.
 265   64: You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
 266   64: room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
 267   64: sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
 268   64: the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
 269   64: adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
 270   64: is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
 271   65: Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
 272   65: tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
 273   66: You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
 274   66: quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
 275   66: to the north, south, east, and down.
 276   67: The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
 277   67: be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
 278   67: the lake.
 279   68: It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
 280   68: the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
 281   68: stream through the gates.
 282   69: There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
 283   69: panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
 284   70: The green bubble is glowing.
 285   71: The water level is now up to your ankles.
 286   72: The water level is now up to your shins.
 287   73: The water level is now up to your knees.
 288   74: The water level is now up to your hips.
 289   75: The water level is now up to your waist.
 290   76: The water level is now up to your chest.
 291   77: The water level is now up to your neck.
 292   78: The water level is now over your head.
 293   79: The water level is now high in your lungs.
 294   80: The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
 295   81: I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
 296   82: You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
 297   82: Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
 298   83: The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
 299   83: suddenly vanish.
 300   84: Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
 301   85: Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
 302   85: smart thing to do, apparently.
 303   86: You seem to be digging a hole here.
 304   87: The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
 305   88: You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
 306   89: You can see a small statue in the sand.
 307   90: The wall collapses, smothering you.
 308   91: There is nothing to dig into here.
 309   92: You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
 310   93: You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
 311   94: You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
 312   95: This is getting you nowhere.
 313   96: You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
 314   96: drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
 315   96: There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
 316   97: A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
 317   98: A solid rainbow spans the falls.
 318   99: According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
 319   99: fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
 320   99: of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
 321   99: out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
 322  100: You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
 323  100: volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
 324  100: below to the floor.
 325  101: The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
 326  102: There is a small door to the south.
 327  103: The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
 328  104: You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
 329  104: for an exit on the north size.
 330  105: Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
 331  105: the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
 332  105: chipped out of the front of it.
 333  106: On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
 334  107: You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
 335  107: There are exits to the east and southeast.
 336  108: As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
 337  109: The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
 338  110: The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
 339  111: The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
 340  112: The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
 341  113: The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
 342  113: chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
 343  113: ground.  Fatally.
 344  114: The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
 345  115: You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
 346  115: that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
 347  115: dungeon has collapsed.
 348  116: The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
 349  116: turning you into a pancake.
 350  117: The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
 351  117: turning you into a pancake.
 352  118: A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
 353  118: "I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
 354  118: trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
 355  118: You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
 356  119: Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
 357  119: seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
 358  119: voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
 359  119: have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
 360  119: all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
 361  119: He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
 362  119: wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
 363  120: Please forward problem reports and suggestions IN WRITING to:
 364  120: 
 365  120:  Digital Equipment Computer Users Society (DECUS)
 366  120:  One Iron Way, MR2-3/E55
 367  120:  Marlboro, Mass. 01752
 368  120:  Attention:  Dungeon Maintenance
 369  121: Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
 370  122: The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
 371  122: at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
 372  123: The lid opens.
 373  124: The lid closes.
 374  125: Look around.
 375  126: You think it isn't?
 376  127: I think you've already done that.
 377  128: The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
 378  128: attempt by robbers to remove it).
 379  129: The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
 380  130: The basket is at the other end of the chain.
 381  131: A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
 382  132: The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
 383  133: The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
 384  134: It is not tied to anything.
 385  135: There is nothing it can be tied to.
 386  136: The rope is already attached.
 387  137: The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
 388  138: I see no objects here.
 389  139: Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
 390  140: The rope drops gently to the floor below.
 391  141: The rope is tied to the railing.
 392  142: The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
 393  143: The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
 394  143: notice an irregularity beneath it.
 395  144: The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
 396  145: With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
 397  145: With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
 398  146: Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
 399  146: to move it again.
 400  147: You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
 401  148: Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
 402  149: The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
 403  149: an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
 404  150: Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
 405  150: than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
 406  151: There is an explosion nearby.
 407  152: The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
 408  153: The match has gone out.
 409  154: The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
 410  155: The lamp is dying.
 411  156: The candles grow short.
 412  157: The candles are very short.
 413  158: The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
 414  159: The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
 415  159: the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
 416  160: As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
 417  160: of blinding blue light.
 418  161: As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
 419  161: overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
 420  161: is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
 421  161: savagely cuts your throat.
 422  162: A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
 423  162: of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
 424  162: all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
 425  162: the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
 426  163: There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
 427  164: There is an ugly person staring at you.
 428  165: The mirror is broken into many pieces.
 429  166: Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
 430  167: You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
 431  167: good luck available.
 432  168: Haven't you done enough already?
 433  169: The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
 434  169: devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
 435  169: downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
 436  169: there is a passageway leading west.
 437  170: The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
 438  170: you in the dark.
 439  171: The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
 440  172: Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
 441  173: burned out ivory torch
 442  174: There is a burned out ivory torch here.
 443  175: The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
 444  176: The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
 445  177: The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
 446  178: You seem unable to affect these spirits.
 447  179: How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
 448  180: The book is open to page 569.
 449  181: As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
 450  182: A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
 451  182: have turned into a pile of dust.
 452  183: I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
 453  184: One of the matches starts to burn.
 454  185: The match is out.
 455  186: The tube refuses to accept anything.
 456  187: The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
 457  188: The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
 458  188: The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
 459  189: The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
 460  189: a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
 461  189: gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
 462  190: The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
 463  190: put in that drink, anyway?).
 464  191: The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
 465  191: your generous gesture.
 466  192: The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
 467  193: The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
 468  194: The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
 469  195: The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
 470  196: The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
 471  197: The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
 472  197: condiments for his upcoming snack.
 473  198: The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
 474  199: You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
 475  200: Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
 476  200: they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
 477  201: The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
 478  202: The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
 479  203: You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
 480  204: Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
 481  204: tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
 482  205: Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
 483  205: artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
 484  206: worthless piece of canvas
 485  207: There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
 486  208: With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
 487  209: The window closes (more easily than it opened).
 488  210: The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
 489  211: The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
 490  212: The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
 491  213: You can't do that!
 492  214: The grating is locked.
 493  215: The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
 494  216: The grating opens.
 495  217: The grating is unlocked.
 496  218: The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
 497  218: into darkness.
 498  219: The door swings shut and closes.
 499  220: The door is locked from above.
 500  221: The door cannot be opened.
 501  222: You cannot burn this door.
 502  223: The door is invulnerable.
 503  224: You cannot damage this door.
 504  225: The door is still under warranty.
 505  226: The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
 506  226: of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
 507  226: excitement fades.
 508  227: The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
 509  228: A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
 510  229: The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
 511  229: "Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
 512  230: The lights within the room shut off.
 513  231: The lights within the room come on.
 514  232: Click.
 515  233: There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
 516  233: from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
 517  233: in a pipe).
 518  234: The blue button appears to be jammed.
 519  235: The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
 520  236: The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
 521  237: You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
 522  238: This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
 523  239: Well done.  The boat is repaired.
 524  240: There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
 525  241: The boat deflates.
 526  242: You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
 527  243: The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
 528  244: Very good.
 529  245: The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
 530  246: Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
 531  246: walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
 532  247: The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
 533  247: precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
 534  247: by water vapor.
 535  248: The ballon is fastened to the hook.
 536  249: The balloon is not tied to anything.
 537  250: The wire falls off the hook.
 538  251: The box is imbedded in the wall.
 539  252: What do you expect, BOOM?
 540  253: The box has no door!
 541  254: The box is rusted and will not open.
 542  255: The box is not open, chomper!
 543  256: The wire starts to burn.
 544  257: "Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
 545  257: # as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
 546  257: of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
 547  257: sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
 548  257: from sight.
 549  258: "That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
 550  258: the # in his rock hard hands.
 551  259: The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
 552  260: Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
 553  260: would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
 554  260: prevent this.
 555  261: Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
 556  261: your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
 557  261: of your life.
 558  262: Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
 559  262: for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
 560  263: As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
 561  263: to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
 562  263: into the room.
 563  264: As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
 564  264: ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
 565  264: Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
 566  264: crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
 567  265: There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
 568  266: Nothing seems to happen.
 569  267: The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
 570  268: The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
 571  269: A dull thump is heard in the distance.
 572  270: The flask breaks into pieces.
 573  271: Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
 574  272: Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
 575  272: flask's contents are fatal.
 576  273: Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
 577  274: The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
 578  274: be clearly visible.
 579  275: You can't see through that!
 580  276: The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
 581  277: The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
 582  278: The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
 583  279: The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
 584  280: The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
 585  281: The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
 586  281: from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
 587  281: with blasting cakes.
 588  282: You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
 589  283: The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
 590  284: The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
 591  284: that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
 592  284: more or less demolished.
 593  285: The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
 594  285: floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
 595  286: How romantic!
 596  287: If you must... Poof, you're dead!
 597  288: The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
 598  288: earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
 599  288: appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
 600  288: seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
 601  288: to tell the tale.
 602  289: There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
 603  289: the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
 604  290: The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
 605  291: The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
 606  292: You notice that the # has burned out, and that
 607  292: the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
 608  293: I hope you have more light than from a #.
 609  294: I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
 610  294: # in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
 611  294: there is still justice in the world.
 612  295: Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
 613  295: gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
 614  296: There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
 615  297: The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
 616  298: You won't melt it with a #.
 617  299: The bolt can't be turned with your #.
 618  300: It seems that a # won't do.
 619  301: With a #?
 620  302: The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
 621  302: appendage in thanks.
 622  303: A #?  Surely you jest.
 623  304: He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
 624  304: kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
 625  305: You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
 626  306: I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
 627  307: At your service!
 628  308: The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
 629  309: Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
 630  310: It could very well be too late.
 631  311: The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
 632  312: Naturally!
 633  313: AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
 634  314: Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
 635  315: Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
 636  316: Are you enjoying yourself?
 637  317: Wheeeeee!
 638  318: Do you expect me to applaud?
 639  319: Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
 640  320: You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
 641  321: It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
 642  322: Tough shit, asshole.
 643  323: Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
 644  324: That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
 645  325: I think you are taking this thing for granite.
 646  326: Brief descriptions.
 647  327: Maximum verbosity.
 648  328: No long descriptions.
 649  329: You can see:  A #.
 650  330: Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
 651  331: I don't really see how.
 652  332: I think that swimming is best performed in water.
 653  333: Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
 654  334: Wasn't he an Indian?
 655  335: I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
 656  335: barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
 657  335: of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
 658  336: Wasn't he a sailor?
 659  337: The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
 660  337: by knocking down the wall on the north size of the room.
 661  338: There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
 662  339: Well what?
 663  340: If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
 664  341: Nothing happens.
 665  342: I don't really know how to do that.
 666  343: Do you wish to leave the game?
 667  344: Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
 668  345: Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
 669  346: Hello.
 670  347: Good day.
 671  348: Nice weather we've been having lately.
 672  349: Goodbye.
 673  350: Here, nothing happens.
 674  351: Nothing happens here.
 675  352: I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
 676  353: You seem to be repeating yourself.
 677  354: The # bows his head to you in greeting.
 678  355: I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
 679  356: It is impossible to read in the dark.
 680  357: How does one look through a #?
 681  358: How can I read a #?
 682  359: How, exactly, do I ring that?
 683  360: Ding, dong.
 684  361: I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
 685  362: If you wish, but I can't understand why.
 686  363: Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
 687  363: you want to brush them with.
 688  364: A nice idea, but with a #?
 689  365: Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
 690  365: glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
 691  365: and you die of respiratory failure.
 692  366: Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
 693  367: Inflating it further would probably burst it.
 694  368: How can you inflate that?
 695  369: Come on, now!
 696  370: The # isn't sleeping.
 697  371: This has no effect.
 698  372: does not seem to do anything useful
 699  373: is not notably useful
 700  374: isn't very interesting
 701  375: doesn't appear worthwhile
 702  376: has no effect
 703  377: doesn't do anything
 704  378: Kicking a # #.
 705  379: Waving a # #.
 706  380: Playing in this way with a # #.
 707  381: Fiddling with a # #.
 708  382: Pushing the # #.
 709  383: I don't think so.
 710  384: This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
 711  385: How can you tie that to anything?
 712  386: You can't tie the # to that.
 713  387: You could certainly never tie the # with that!
 714  388: The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
 715  389: Why would you tie up a #?
 716  390: You can't turn that.
 717  391: You certainly can't turn it with a #.
 718  392: Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
 719  393: Digging with a # is silly.
 720  394: I don't think that anybody is home.
 721  395: Why knock on a #?
 722  396: It sounds like there is something inside the #.
 723  397: The contents of the # spill out.
 724  398: I can't get to that to move it.
 725  399: You can't move the #.
 726  400: You can't turn that on.
 727  401: It is already on.
 728  402: You can't turn that off.
 729  403: It is already off.
 730  404: The # is now on.
 731  405: The # is now off.
 732  406: It is now pitch black.
 733  407: You must tell me how to do that to a #.
 734  408: The # cannot be opened.
 735  409: Opened.
 736  410: Opening the # reveals:
 737  411: The # cannot be closed.
 738  412: It is already open.
 739  413: It is already closed.
 740  414: Closed.
 741  415: There is a # here.
 742  416: You are carrying a #.
 743  417: It is in the #, which is in the room.
 744  418: It is in the #, which you are carrying.
 745  419: Time passes...
 746  420: The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
 747  421: I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
 748  422: You are already in the #, cretin!
 749  423: You are now in the #.
 750  424: You aren't in that!
 751  425: You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
 752  425: be fatal.
 753  426: You are on your own feet again.
 754  427: You can't go there without a vehicle.
 755  428: You can't go there in a #.
 756  429: I see nothing special about the #.
 757  430: It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
 758  431: You are in the #.
 759  432: The # has died.
 760  433: The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
 761  433: the guttural tongue of the trolls.
 762  434: The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
 763  434: bloody axe.
 764  435: An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
 765  435: of the room are open.
 766  436: A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
 767  436: out of the room.
 768  437: The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
 769  438: The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
 770  439: The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
 771  440: The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
 772  441: The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
 773  442: and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
 774  443: and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
 775  443: troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
 776  443: not look pleased.
 777  444: Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
 778  445: You can't take the #.
 779  446: Aren't you forgetting something?
 780  447: That would be a good trick.
 781  448: The # is too big to jump over.
 782  449: You should have looked before you leaped.
 783  450: I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
 784  451: In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
 785  452: Geronimo...
 786  453: I don't think that the # would agree with you.
 787  454: I think you should get that first.
 788  455: Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
 789  456: How can I drink that?
 790  457: I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
 791  458: Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
 792  458: this talking.
 793  459: The # catches fire.
 794  460: Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
 795  461: You don't have that.
 796  462: The # catches fire and is consumed.
 797  463: I don't think you can burn a #.
 798  464: It doesn't seem to work.
 799  465: Can you unlock a grating with a #?
 800  466: Munging a # #.
 801  467: Trying to kill a # #.
 802  468: Trying to attack a # #.
 803  469: There is nothing here to attack.
 804  470: I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
 805  471: with your bare hands is suicidal
 806  472: with that is very self-destructive
 807  473: You are in perfect health.
 808  474: You have a light wound.
 809  475: You have a serious wound.
 810  476: You have several wounds.
 811  477: You have serious wounds.
 812  478: You are at death's door.
 813  479: You can be killed by one more light wound.
 814  480: You can be killed by a serious wound.
 815  481: You can survive one serious wound.
 816  482: You are strong enough to take several wounds.
 817  483: You have been killed once.
 818  484: You have been killed twice.
 819  485: This gives you the rank of Cheater.
 820  486: This gives you the rank of Wizard.
 821  487: This gives you the rank of Master.
 822  488: This gives you the rank of Winner.
 823  489: This gives you the rank of Hacker.
 824  490: This gives you the rank of Adventurer.
 825  491: This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.
 826  492: This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.
 827  493: This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.
 828  494: This gives you the rank of Beginner.
 829  495: Your sword is no longer glowing.
 830  496: Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
 831  497: You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
 832  498: Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
 833  498: neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
 834  499: The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
 835  499: recovers his stilletto.
 836  500: His booty remains.
 837  501: As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
 838  501: treasures reappear:  A #.
 839  502:   A #.
 840  503: There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
 841  503: against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
 842  504: There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
 843  504: ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
 844  505: The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
 845  505: when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
 846  506: Once you got him, what would you do with him?
 847  507: You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
 848  507: it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
 849  507: seem angered by your attempt.
 850  508: You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
 851  509: You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
 852  509: but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
 853  510: Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
 854  511: The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
 855  511: stupid as you are?
 856  512: The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
 857  513: The candles are not lit.
 858  514: The flame is extinguished.
 859  515: Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
 860  515: burn.
 861  516: With what?
 862  517: The candles are lit.
 863  518: The candles are already lit.
 864  519: You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
 865  520: You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
 866  521: The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
 867  522: Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
 868  523: Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
 869  524: You can't go that way.
 870  525: The # is closed.
 871  526: I can't reach that.
 872  527: You aren't carrying that.
 873  528: Dropped.
 874  529: Thrown.
 875  530: You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
 876  531: The balloon has landed.
 877  532: You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
 878  533: You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
 879  534: The balloon descends.
 880  535: You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
 881  536: Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
 882  536: causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
 883  537: You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
 884  538: The balloon ascends.
 885  539: You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
 886  539: due to its light load.
 887  540: The balloon leaves the ledge.
 888  541: You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
 889  542: The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
 890  543: The cloth bag is draped over the side.
 891  544: The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
 892  544: in the receptacle.
 893  545: The balloon is tied to the hook.
 894  546: I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
 895  547: You are tied to the ledge.
 896  548: You don't really want to hold a burning #.
 897  549: The receptacle is already occupied.
 898  550: The # burns inside the receptacle.
 899  551: The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
 900  552: Not likely.
 901  553: An interesting idea, but...
 902  554: A valiant attempt.
 903  555: You can't be serious.
 904  556: Not a prayer.
 905  557: You already have it.
 906  558: Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
 907  559: Taken.
 908  560: Nice try.
 909  561: I can't do that.
 910  562: I can't reach inside.
 911  563: How can you do that?
 912  564: The # is already in the #.
 913  565: It won't fit.
 914  566: I can't reach the #.
 915  567: The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
 916  568: "I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
 917  569: "My vision is not that good without eyes."
 918  570: "I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
 919  571: ECHO
 920  571: The acoustics of the room change subtly.
 921  572: Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
 922  572: sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
 923  572: carcass has disappeared.
 924  573: The # contains:
 925  574: Your collection of treasures consists of:
 926  575: You are carrying:
 927  576: The # is carrying:
 928  577: By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
 929  577: stop the leak in the dam.
 930  578: You are empty handed.
 931  579: It is too dark in here to see.
 932  580: #:
 933  581: I could't find anything.
 934  582: I couldn't find any valuables.
 935  583: Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
 936  583: walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
 937  583: the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
 938  584: Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
 939  584: valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
 940  584: nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
 941  585: The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
 942  585: Fortunately, he took nothing.
 943  586: A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
 944  586: nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
 945  587: A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
 946  587: the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
 947  587: room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
 948  587: others before...".
 949  588: The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
 950  588: left disgusted.
 951  589: The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
 952  589: have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
 953  590: Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
 954  590: fine # is doing here?"
 955  591: You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
 956  591: ineffective.
 957  592: Attacking a dead # is pointless.
 958  593: Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
 959  594: The # slowly regains his feet.
 960  595: The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
 961  596: It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
 962  596: that you are dead.
 963  597: Saved.
 964  598: I can't access the save file.
 965  599: Restored.
 966  600: Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
 967  601: I don't understand that.
 968  602: You cannot talk to that!
 969  603: You cannot talk through another person.
 970  604: Please input the entire command again.
 971  605: Fortunately, you still have a #.
 972  606: You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
 973  606: leading up.
 974  607: A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
 975  607: adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
 976  607: and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
 977  607: friendly, though he likes people.
 978  608: The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
 979  608: think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
 980  608: a cyclops.
 981  609: The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
 982  609: His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
 983  610: The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
 984  610: blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
 985  611: On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
 986  611: now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
 987  612: The bottle is closed.
 988  613: The bottle is already full.
 989  614: The bottle is now full of water.
 990  615: The water slips through your fingers.
 991  616: Too many prepositions.
 992  617: Too many objects.
 993  618: I can't see one here.
 994  619: Which one do you mean?
 995  620: I can't reach that from inside the #.
 996  621: What should I do with the #?
 997  622: Huh?
 998  623: You must supply a direct object.
 999  624: You must supply an indirect object.
1000  625: Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
1001  625: abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
1002  625: Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
1003  626: The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
1004  626: your greeting with his usual graciousness.
1005  627: The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
1006  627: the # and stops to admire its beauty.
1007  628: The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
1008  629: The # is empty.
1009  630: I don't know how to look inside a #.
1010  631: There is nothing interesting there.
1011  632: I don't really see how.
1012  633: The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
1013  634: You can't wind a #.
1014  635: You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
1015  636: A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
1016  636: in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
1017  636: surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
1018  636: brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
1019  637: An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
1020  637: safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
1021  637: forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
1022  637: box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
1023  637: here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
1024  637: askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
1025  638: The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
1026  638: you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
1027  638: leaving you alone in the bare room.
1028  639: Talk about eating rich foods!
1029  640: Nothing like having money to burn!
1030  641: "I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
1031  641: disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
1032  641: understated "pop".
1033  642: The gnome carefully places the # in the
1034  642: deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
1035  642: that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
1036  642: disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
1037  643: The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
1038  643: fingers, leaving you alone.
1039  644: The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
1040  645: There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
1041  646: The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
1042  647: The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
1043  647: From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
1044  647: limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
1045  647: a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
1046  647: of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
1047  647: down, the song bird flies away.
1048  648: The cliff is too steep for climbing.
1049  649: The egg is already open.
1050  650: There is no obvious way to open the egg.
1051  651: I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
1052  652: The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
1053  652: seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
1054  653: The concept of using a # is certainly original.
1055  654: Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
1056  655: You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
1057  655: The egg is now open.
1058  656: Climbing the walls is of no avail.
1059  657: Bizarre!
1060  658: The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
1061  659: The # falls to the ground.
1062  660: You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
1063  660: branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
1064  661: On the ground below you can see:
1065  662: I can't see any wall here.
1066  663: That cannot be turned.
1067  664: You would be lost without me.
1068  665: You don't have the #.
1069  666: The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
1070  667: I can't see any song bird here.
1071  668: You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
1072  669: You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
1073  670: You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
1074  671: That would involve quite a contortion!
1075  672: You are in it, turkey!
1076  673: As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
1077  674: The # goes through it.
1078  675: The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
1079  676: The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
1080  677: I can't do that with everything at once.
1081  678: There is a wall there.
1082  679: There is no way up.
1083  680: There is no way down.
1084  681: You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
1085  681: dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
1086  681: In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
1087  681: which is engraved a compass rose.
1088  682: Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
1089  682: pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
1090  682: Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
1091  682: portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
1092  682: around formidable bludgeons.
1093  683: Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
1094  683: pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
1095  683: Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
1096  683: portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
1097  683: around formidable bludgeons.
1098  684: A passage enters from the south.
1099  685: The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
1100  685: their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
1101  686: To the north and south are large hallways.
1102  687: To the north is a large hallway.
1103  688: You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
1104  688: complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
1105  688: is open.
1106  688:    As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
1107  688: carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
1108  688: is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
1109  688: half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
1110  688: opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
1111  688: black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
1112  688: the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
1113  688:    In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
1114  688: deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
1115  688: exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
1116  688: depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
1117  688: area is a compass rose.
1118  688:    Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
1119  688: is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
1120  688: in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
1121  688: in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
1122  688: (as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
1123  688: pole.
1124  688:    The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
1125  689: foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
1126  689: the stone floor.
1127  690: foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
1128  690: dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
1129  691: foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
1130  691: out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
1131  691: friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
1132  692: foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
1133  692: dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.
1134  693: foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
1135  693: above the stone channel in the floor.
1136  694:    The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
1137  694: through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
1138  694: bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
1139  694: attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
1140  694: T-bar are pointing #.
1141  695: north
1142  696: northeast
1143  697: east
1144  698: southeast
1145  699: south
1146  700: southwest
1147  701: west
1148  702: northwest
1149  703: You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
1150  703: and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
1151  703: end, inches above the floor.
1152  704: You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
1153  704: and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
1154  704: end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
1155  704: room by a # lying on the floor.
1156  705: Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
1157  705: sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
1158  705: this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
1159  705: the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
1160  705: crypt to the south.  The door is #.
1161  706: You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
1162  706: and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
1163  706: additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
1164  707: In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
1165  707: which is #.
1166  708: You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
1167  708: and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
1168  709: You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
1169  710: The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
1170  710: panel is #, and the door is #.
1171  711: You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
1172  711: parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
1173  711: towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
1174  711: ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
1175  711: window barred with iron.  The door is #.
1176  712: You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
1177  712: parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
1178  712: smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
1179  712: bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
1180  712: is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
1181  712: two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
1182  712: so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
1183  712:    There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
1184  712: an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
1185  712: of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
1186  712: to the number "#".
1187  713: one
1188  714: two
1189  715: three
1190  716: four
1191  717: five
1192  718: six
1193  719: seven
1194  720: eight
1195  721: You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
1196  721: and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
1197  721: in front of you.
1198  722: You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
1199  722: corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
1200  723: Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
1201  724: You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
1202  724: fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
1203  724: its small window.
1204  725: You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
1205  725: fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
1206  725: its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
1207  725: which seems to be #.
1208  726:    As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
1209  726: master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
1210  726: solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
1211  726: your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
1212  726: waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
1213  726: lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
1214  726: You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
1215  726: moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
1216  726: treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
1217  726: and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
1218  727: Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
1219  727: disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
1220  727: As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
1221  727: and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
1222  727: Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
1223  727: future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
1224  727: transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
1225  727:  INCANT, <word>
1226  727: and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
1227  727:  INCANT, <phrase>
1228  727: Good luck, and choose wisely!"
1229  728: The button pops back to its original position.
1230  729: The mirror quietly swings shut.
1231  730: The pine wall closes quietly.
1232  731: The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
1233  732: The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
1234  733: The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
1235  734: The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
1236  735: The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
1237  736: The pine wall swings open.
1238  737: The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
1239  738: The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
1240  738: budge.
1241  739: The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
1242  740: The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
1243  741: The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
1244  742: The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
1245  742: suspicions are aroused.
1246  743: Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
1247  743: them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
1248  743: the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
1249  743: resume their posts.
1250  744: A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
1251  744: are aroused.
1252  745: Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
1253  745: Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
1254  745: they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
1255  746: The statues are impassive.
1256  747: The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
1257  747: blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
1258  747: his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
1259  747: completes you crumble into dust.
1260  748: "I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
1261  749: The pole is now slightly above the floor.
1262  750: The pole cannot be raised further.
1263  751: The pole cannot be lowered further.
1264  752: The pole is lowered into the channel.
1265  753: The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
1266  754: The pole is already resting on the floor.
1267  755: The pole now rests on the stone floor.
1268  756: The button becomes depressed.
1269  757: The button pops back out.
1270  758: The button is already depressed.
1271  759: No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
1272  760: The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
1273  761: You can't break the beam with a #.
1274  762: The # already breaks the beam.
1275  763: I see no bronze door here.
1276  764: The bronze door opens.
1277  765: The bronze door closes.
1278  766: On the other size of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
1279  766: into a larger area.
1280  767: The door won't budge.
1281  768: The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
1282  768: will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
1283  768: panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
1284  768: old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
1285  768:    "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
1286  768: that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
1287  768: admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
1288  768: you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
1289  768: Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
1290  768: one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
1291  768: discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
1292  768: Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
1293  768: attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
1294  768: admit you to these regions.
1295  768:    "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
1296  769: The booming voice asks:
1297  770: "From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
1298  770: through the cyclops room?"
1299  771: "Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
1300  772: "What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
1301  772: treasures, in Zorkmids?"
1302  773: "What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
1303  774: "What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"
1304  775: "The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
1305  776: "What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
1306  777: "In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
1307  778: The door is securely fastened.
1308  779: The wooden door opens.
1309  780: The wooden door closes.
1310  781: The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
1311  782: The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
1312  783: There is no reply.
1313  784: "I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."
1314  785: "I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."
1315  786: "I cannot perform that action for you."
1316  787: This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
1317  788: This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.
1318  789: This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.
1319  790: This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.
1320  791: This gives you the rank of Cheater.
1321  792: You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
1322  792: says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
1323  792: In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
1324  792: is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
1325  792: headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
1326  792: cryptic inscription:
1327  792: 
1328  792:   "Feel Free".
1329  793: The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
1330  794: The crypt is already open.
1331  795: The crypt is already closed.
1332  796: The crypt is closed.
1333  797: The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".
1334  798: There is no answer.
1335  799: No one seems to be listening.
1336  800: The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
1337  801: The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."
1338  802: The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."
1339  803: The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."
1340  804: The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."
1341  805: The mirror is closed.
1342  806: You must specify what to set the dial to.
1343  807: The dial face contains only numbers.
1344  808: The dial now points to "#".
1345  809: The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
1346  810: The cell door is now closed.
1347  811: You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.
1348  812: The dungeon master catches up with you.
1349  813: The dungeon master follows you.
1350  814: There is a wooden wall blocking your way.
1351  815: There is a large mirror blocking your way.
1352  816: There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.
1353  817: The structure blocks your way.
1354  818: As you leave, the door swings shut.
1355  819: You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.
1356  820: You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.
1357  821: You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
1358  821: which once contained a mirror.
1359  822: You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
1360  822: which once contained a mirror.
1361  823: The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
1362  824: The panel has been opened outward.
1363  825: The opposite wall is solid rock.
1364  826: The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
1365  826: obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
1366  826: and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
1367  826: With that, he departs.
1368  827: The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
1369  827: master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
1370  827: wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
1371  828: Saves are not permitted during the endgame.
1372  829: Restores are not permitted during the endgame.
1373  830: The structure rotates clockwise.
1374  831: The structure rotates counterclockwise.
1375  832: I can't see a mirror here.
1376  833: I don't see any way to open the mirror here.
1377  834: The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.
1378  835: The mirror has already been broken.
1379  836: The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
1380  836: as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
1381  836: fragile.
1382  837: The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.
1383  838: I can't see a panel here.
1384  839: I don't see any way to open the panel here.
1385  840: To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.
1386  841: The panel is not that easily destroyed.
1387  842: The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
1388  842: when you let go.
1389  843: The panel is unyielding.
1390  844: A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.
1391  845: The mirror is broken into little pieces.
1392  846: Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.
1393  847: The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
1394  848: hallways to the #east and #west.
1395  849: A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.
1396  850: A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.
1397  851: The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.
1398  852: The corridor continues north.
1399  853: The corridor continues south.
1400  854: The corridor continues north and south.
1401  855: Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.
1402  856: That incantation seems to have been a failure.
1403  857: Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
1404  858: That spell has no obvious effect.
1405  859: As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
1406  859: envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.
1407  860: The structure won't budge.
1408  861: You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east.
1409  862: You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.
1410  863: The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel
1411  863: door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
1412  863: later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
1413  863:  "Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"
1414  864: The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
1415  864: unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
1416  864: now atomized, spews through the slot.
1417  865: I can't see any ladder here.
1418  866: Come, come!
1419  867: You hit your head on the ceiling and fall off the ladder.
1420  868: You are in a small square room bounded to the north and west with
1421  868: marble walls and to the east and south with sandstone walls.
1422  869: It appears the thief was correct.
1423  870: In the ceiling above you is a large circular opening.
1424  871: The center of the floor is noticeably depressed here.
1425  872: The west wall here has a large steel door at its center.  On one side

1693   58: north is a small opening.
1694   59: You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
1695   59: mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,

1724   75: You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken

1726   75: southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
1727   76: You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
1728   76: shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
1729   76: passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
1730   81: You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
1731   81: There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
1732   82: You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
1733   82: seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow

1735   84: You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
1736   85: A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
1737   85: path exits to the south and to the east.
1738   86: You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but

1740   86: damp here.
1741   87: A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
1742   87: cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.

1745   90: You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
1746   91: This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
1747   91: To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
1748   91: following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
1749   91: solving this riddle--
1750   91:  What is tall as a house,
1751   91:  Round as a cup,
1752   91:  And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
1753   92: This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
1754   95: You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
1755   95: stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
1756   96: You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
1757   96: ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
1758   96: The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
1759   96: room is through huge marble pillars.
1760   97: You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
1761   97: appears to be an altar.
1762   99: This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
1763   99: the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
1764   99: "PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
1765  100: You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
1766  100: control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
1767  100: room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
1768  100: the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
1769  100: panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
1770  100: different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
1771  100: room are in the west and south ends.
1772  102: You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
1773  102: east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
1774  102: cyclops sized).
1775  103: This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
1776  103: of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
1777  103: on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
1778  103: created passage to the east.
1779  104: You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
1780  104: and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
1781  104: Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
1782  104: northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
1783  104: extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
1784  104: you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
1785  104: could get back down.
1786  105: You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
1787  105: have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
1788  105: left through the north, south, or west exits.
1789  106: You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
1790  106: and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
1791  106: river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
1792  106: from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
1793  106: way downstream.
1794  107: You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
1795  107: flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
1796  108: The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
1797  108: dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
1798  108: prevent landing on the west.
1799  109: The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
1800  109: the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
1801  109: may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
1802  110: You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
1803  110: white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
1804  110: along the cliffs.
1805  111: You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
1806  111: narrow path leads north along the shore.
1807  112: The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
1808  112: that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
1809  112: area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
1810  113: The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
1811  113: shore is a large landing area.
1812  115: You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
1813  115: treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
1814  115: quickly turning around a sharp corner.
1815  116: You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
1816  116: flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
1817  117: You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
1818  117: to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
1819  118: You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
1820  119: You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
1821  119: barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
1822  121: You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
1823  121: on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
1824  121: travels east-west here.
1825  122: You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
1826  122: past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
1827  122: cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
1828  122: above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
1829  122: continues to the southeast.
1830  123: You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
1831  123: here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
1832  123: runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
1833  124: You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
1834  124: You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
1835  124: along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
1836  124: canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
1837  124: climbable.
1838  125: You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
1839  125: there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
1840  125: upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
1841  125: appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
1842  125: northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
1843  125: Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
1844  125: top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
1845  125: west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
1846  125: around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
1847  126: You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
1848  126: light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
1849  126: exit here is to the north.
1850  127: You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
1851  127: top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
1852  128: You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
1853  128: above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
1854  128: west side.
1855  129: You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
1856  129: the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
1857  129: east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
1858  130: You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
1859  130: across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
1860  131: You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
1861  131: volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
1862  131: floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
1863  132: You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
1864  132: the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
1865  132: A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
1866  132: it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
1867  132: those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
1868  134: You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
1869  134: for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
1870  134: to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
1871  136: You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
1872  136: There are exits here to the west and the south.
1873  139: You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
1874  139: smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
1875  139: sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
1876  139: which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
1877  139: above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
1878  139: above all the buttons says in English:
1879  139: 
1880  139:       DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
1881  139: 
1882  139: There are exits to the west and the south.
1883  140: You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
1884  140: is a small sticker which reads:
1885  140: 
1886  140:   Protected by
1887  140:     FROBOZZ
1888  140:       Magic Alarm Company
1889  140:        (Hello, footpad!).
1890  141: You are trapped inside an steel cage.
1891  142: You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
1892  142: the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
1893  142: entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
1894  143: You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
1895  143: mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
1896  143: some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
1897  144: You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
1898  144: oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
1899  144: objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
1900  144: corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
1901  144: There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
1902  145: You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
1903  145: posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
1904  145: be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
1905  145: abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
1906  145: chasm on the west and the northwest.
1907  146: You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
1908  146: large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
1909  146: falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
1910  148: You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
1911  148: banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
1912  148: account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
1913  148: the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
1914  148: less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
1915  148: "I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
1916  148: Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
1917  148: that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
1918  148: the room, which say
1919  148: 
1920  148:  <-- WEST VIEWING ROOM  EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
1921  149: You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
1922  149: whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
1923  149: On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
1924  149: On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
1925  149: 
1926  149:       BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
1927  150: You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
1928  150: whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
1929  150: On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
1930  150: On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
1931  150: 
1932  150:       BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
1933  151: You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
1934  151: their contents.  On the north size of the room is a sign which says
1935  151: 
1936  151:    REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
1937  151:     WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
1938  151:      AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
1939  151:       REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
1940  151:                Thank you for banking at the Zork!
1941  152: You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
1942  152: their contents.  On the north size of the room is a sign which says
1943  152: 
1944  152:    REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
1945  152:     WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
1946  152:      AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
1947  152:       REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
1948  152:                Thank you for banking at the Zork!
1949  153: You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
1950  153: are no exits from this room.
1951  154: You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
1952  155: You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
1953  155: were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
1954  155: all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
1955  155: and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
1956  155: of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
1957  155: room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
1958  155: the side of the cube is some lettering.
1959  156: This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
1960  156: Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
1961  156: The lone exit is to the north.
1962  158: You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
1963  158: a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
1964  158: passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
1965  159: You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
1966  159: south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illum-
1967  159: inated by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
1968  159: is a red button.
1969  180: You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
1970  180: widens into larger areas as it turns east at its northern and
1971  180: southern ends.
1972  181: You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
1973  181: widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
1974  181: southern ends.
1975  187: You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
1976  187: in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
1977  187: contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
1978  187:    There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
1979  187: zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
1980  187:    In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
1981  187: as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
1982  187: the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
1983  187: other informative and inspiring works.
1984  187:    On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
1985  187: Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
1986  187: and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
1987  187:    On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
1988  187: certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
1989  187: International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
1990  187: of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
1991  188: You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
1992  188: created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
1993  188: feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There
1994  188: are exits to the west and south.

2558  158: crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of
2559  158: intricate machinery.  It is not clear what result winding it would
2560  158: have, as the mainspring appears sprung.
2561  188: Nestled inside the niche is an engraved gold card.
2562   41: The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
2563   41: an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
2564   41: ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
2565   41: are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
2566   41: texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
2567   41: to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
2568   44: The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
2569   44: remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
2570   44: be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects, absent-
2571   44: mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
2572   44: final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
2573   44: dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
2574   44: Zorkers were obscure indeed.
2575   47:   Commandment #12592
2576   47: Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":
2577   47: Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
2578   47: Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
2579   47: Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
2580   47: Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
2581   47: Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
2582   47: unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
2583   47: Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

2585   49:   Flood Control Dam #3
2586   49: 
2587   49:   Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
2588   49: Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
2589   49: Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
2590   49: zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
2591   49: tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
2592   49: is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
2593   49: center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
2594   49: the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
2595   49: square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
2596   49: 
2597   49:   The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
2598   49: the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
2599   49: drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
2600   49: tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
2601   49: bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
2602   49: 12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
2603   49: processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
2604   49: 
2605   49:   We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
2606   49: FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

2618   50:   --- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---
2619   50: 
2620   50: This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
2621   50: reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
2622   50: at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
2623   50: parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
2624   50: is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.
2625   50:

2638   51: 
2639   51: Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
2640   51: to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
2641   51: I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
2642   51: 
2643   51: Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
2644   51: forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
2645   51: future and make really big Zorkmids."
2646   51: 
2647   51: MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
2648   51: you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

2652   52: 
2653   52:    Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
2654   52: you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
2655   52: man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
2656   52: within.
2657   52: 
2658   52:    In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
2659   52: of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
2660   52: vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
2661   52: fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
2662   52: 
2663   52:    No DECsystem should be without one!
2664   52: 
2665   52:    Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
2666   52: Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
2667   52: Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
2668   52: Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
2669   52: and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
2670   52: The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
2671   52: a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.
