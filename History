History of the C and Unix f77 Implementations of Dungeon
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This version of Zork is a translation from the original, written in MDL, initially into DEC FORTRAN.
See the file "dungeon.doc" for the complete original documentation.
See the file "PDP.doc" for notes on the Unix/pdp implementation.

It was modified from this source so that it would compile and execute on Unix[TM] Systems using the f77 FORTRAN Compiler.
It was later translated from FORTRAN to C, with the help of f2c, the FORTRAN to C translator written by
David Gay (AT&T Bell Labs), Stu Feldman (Bellcore), Mark Maimone (Carnegie-Mellon University), and Norm Schryer (AT&T Bell Labs).

The f77 FORTRAN version was later modified to work with g77, before being included in this repository,
and has now been modified to work with gfortran.

The original translation to C is not included here, but in a separate repository,
and is being used to guide a new, independent, translation here to C.
Below is the history of the translations

I. 1980/10/08: From the original documentation ...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
To:	Dungeon Players
From:	"The Translator"
Subj:	Game Information
Date:	8-OCT-80

This is the first (and last) source release of the PDP-11 version of Dungeon.

Please note that Dungeon has been superceded by the game ZORK(tm).
The following is an extract from the new product announcement for ZORK in the September, 1980 issue of the RT-11 SIG newsletter:

	"'ZORK:  The Great Underground Empire - Part I' ...
	was developed by the original authors based on their ZORK (Dungeon) game for the PDP-10.
	It features a greatly improved parser; command input and transcript output files;
	SAVEs to any device and file name; and adaptation to different terminal types, including a status line on VT100s.
	Note: this is not the FORTRAN version that has been available through DECUS.
	This version has been completely rewritten to run efficiently on small machines -
	up to 10 times as fast as the DECUS version.

	... ZORK runs under RT-11, HT-11, or RSTS/E and requires as little as 20K words of memory and a single floppy disk drive.
	The game package, consisting of an RX01-format diskette and an instruction booklet, is available from
	Infocom, Inc., P.O. Box 120, Kendall Station, Cambridge, Ma. 02142."

ZORK(tm) is a trademark of Infocom, Inc.
It is available for several popular personal computers as well as for the PDP-11.

Summary
───────
Welcome to Dungeon!

Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.
In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.
Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within.

In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth,
searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

No DECsystem should be without one!

Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science
by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.
It was inspired by the Adventure game of Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax and Arneson.
The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous.

On-line information may be obtained with the commands HELP and INFO.

II. 1981/11/17: DEC FORTRAN to f77 Conversion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The conversion from DEC FORTRAN to Unix f77 was done by Randy Dietrich, Lynn Cochran and Sig Peterson.
Much hacking was done to get it to fit in the limited address space of a PDP-11/44 (split I/D).
See the file "PDP.doc" for all the gory details.
Suffice it to say that by leaving out the debugging package and not linking in the f77 I/O library they managed to get it to run.

III. 1985/12: PDP to VAX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Based on the work of Randy, Lynn and Sig,
Bill Randle folded in the full save/restore functions and the game debugging package (gdt)
into the pdp version to create a Vax/Unix version.
This version also uses f77 I/O, thus eliminating the extra speak and listen processes needed on the pdp.

IV. 1986/12/11: Cleanup I
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
John Gilmore (hoptoad!gnu) cleaned up the source files by moving most of the common declarations into include files
and added comments from the original (FORTRAN or MDL?) source.
His efforts are greatly appreciated.

V. 1987/02/09: Cleanup II
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Bill Randle (billr@tekred.tek.com) added the pdp dependencies back into the Vax source files
with #ifdefs in order to have just one set of sources.
Previously, there were two sets of source: one for the pdp and one for the Vax.
In addition, a shell escape of the form !cmd was added and the wizard can enter the gdt without having to recompile the source.
Finally, a man page was generated, based on the dungeon.doc file.

VI. 1991/03/11: f77 to C
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ian Lance Taylor (ian@airs.com or uunet!airs!ian) used the f2c translator to generate C source code.
The resulting code was modified to remove the FORTRAN I/O library, to add more simple processing,
and to change the format of the database file.
Andre Srinivasan (andre@cs.pitt.edu) help test it.
Jonathan Mark (uunet!microsoft!jonm) made it work under MS-DOS and Microsoft C.
