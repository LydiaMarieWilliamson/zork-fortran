The results of translation from Fortran into C by f2c.

Addendum (2021/09/17):
	The original Fortran source was a translation from MDL and contains translation errors in blkdata.f.
	The encodings used for data initialization in the MDL version are in base 40 with:
		"1Rα": 1600a,
		"2Rαβ": 1600a + 40b,
		"3Rαβγ": 1600a + 40b + c
	where
		(α,a), (β,b), (γ,c) ∈ { ('A',1), ⋯, ('Z',26), ('$',27), ⋯, ('0',30), ('1',31), ⋯, ('9',39) }
	In blkdata.f, there are mismatches in the following places:
	∙	(1RO, 0): Mismatched value (it should be 24000).
	∙	(1RS, 29560): Mismatched value (it should be 30400); 29560 corresponds to 2RRS.
	∙	(1RY, 4000): Mismatched value (it should be 40000).
	∙	(3RMIN, 21175): Mismatched value (it should be 21174).
	∙	(3RPAP, 256656): Mismatched value (it should be 25656).

	These inconsistencies have also been inherited by the translations of Zork into C.
	They will all need to be repaired

The following note (up to layout changes) was inserted by f2c into the translated files, but has been moved here:

	Translated by f2c (version 20190311).
	You must link the resulting object file with libf2c:
	∙	on Microsoft Windows system, link with libf2c.lib;
	∙	on Linux or Unix systems, link with .../path/to/libf2c.a -lm
	∙	or, if you install libf2c.a in a standard place, with -lf2c -lm
	-- in that order, at the end of the command line, as in
		cc *.o -lf2c -lm
	Source for libf2c is in /netlib/f2c/libf2c.zip, e.g.,
		http://www.netlib.org/f2c/libf2c.zip

as well as the following include:

	#include "f2c.h"

which has been changed to

	#include "F2C.h"

with the system "f2c.h" directly added here and internalized as "F2C.h", where it will be whittled away.
The system-dependent part of the original "f2c.h" has already been removed from "F2C.h", since it's not used anywhere.
Most of the ‟Fortran”-isms have also been removed from "F2C.h" and rendered in native C.
