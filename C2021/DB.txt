#000931:Useful commands:
       :
       :   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
       :for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
       :printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
       :command restores long descriptions.
       :   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
       :of what the game is about.
       :   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
       :to continue playing.
       :   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
       :   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
       :   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
       :   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
       :   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
       :   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
       :   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
       :
       :Command abbreviations:
       :
       :   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
       :   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
       :   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
       :
       :Containment:
       :
       :   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
       :be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
       :not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
       :which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
       :to see such an object, the container must be either open or
       :transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
       :the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
       :sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
       :in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
       :will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
       :process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
       :can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
       :one level down.
       :
       :Fighting:
       :
       :   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
       :attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
       :Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
       :etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
       :fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
       :getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
       :Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
       :fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
       :should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
       :
       :Command parser:
       :
       :   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
       :For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
       :first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
       :'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
       :creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this truncation
       :may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
       :
       :   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
       :the following types of things--
       :
       :   Actions:
       :	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
       :	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
       :	PUT DOWN, etc.
       :
       :   Directions:
       :	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
       :	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
       :	only certain situations.
       :
       :   Objects:
       :	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
       :
       :   Adjectives:
       :	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
       :	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
       :	DOORs, BUTTONs).
       :
       :   Prepositions:
       :	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
       :	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
       :	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
       :	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
       :	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
       :	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
       :
       :   Sentences:
       :	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic constructions.
       :	In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
       :	can be placed on the same line.
       :
       :   Ambiguity:
       :	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
       :	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
       :	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
       :	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
       :	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
#005260:Welcome to Dungeon!
       :
       :   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
       :quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
       :In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
       :receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
       :case in the living room of the house.
       :
       :   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
       :which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
       :need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
       :since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
       :material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
       :is rumored to be useful.
       :
       :   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
       :When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
       :certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
       :the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
       :safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
       :addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
       :with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
       :which you may do only twice.
       :
       :   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
       :likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
       :light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
       :rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
       :you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
       :he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
       :his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally
       :stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
       :through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
#007064:Please answer the question.
#007092:You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
       :dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
       :installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
       :may gloat over them.
#007324:What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
       :RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
#007455:Now let me see...
       :Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
       :everything.
#007552:Do you wish me to try to patch you?
#007588:You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
       :there is a window which is #.
#007678:open
#007683:slightly ajar
#007697:You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
       :been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
       :the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
       :east is a small window which is #.
#007933:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
       :is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
       :nailed shut.
#008085:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
       :is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
       :strange gothic lettering.
#008250:In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
#008301:In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
#008350:In the center of the room is an open trap door.
#008398:There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
#008446:You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
       :east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
       :steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
#008619:The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
#008675:You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
       :passages in the immediate vicinity.
#008768:Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
#008832:Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
#008887:Above you is a grating.
#008911:You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
       :and south.
#008987:There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
#009041:There is an open grating descending into darkness.
#009092:A grating appears on the ground.
#009125:You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
#009189:You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
       :reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
       :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#009371:There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
       :climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
#009475:You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
       :Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
       :cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
#009654:You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
       :large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
#009779:You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
#009842:You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
       :a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
       :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#010035:There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
#010084:You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
       :and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
#010206:Part of the glacier has been melted.
#010243:There is a large passageway leading westward.
#010289:You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
       :on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
       :an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
#010475:Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
       :actions.
#010547:		BOOOOOOOOOM
#010561:You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
       :corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
       :dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
       :obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
       :label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manipulable
       :by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
       :inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
#011031:closed
#011038:The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
#011109:You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
#011170:In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
       :is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
#011282:A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
       :from the ceiling and lifts you away...
#011379:You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
       :of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
       :wooden railing which circles the dome.
#011552:Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
       :from the floor below.
#011640:I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
#011696:You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
       :staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
       :large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
       :around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
       :center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
#012022:A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
       :five feet above your head.
#012116:You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
#012182:Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
#012250:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
       :fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
       :I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
#012451:You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
       :
       :	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
       :
       :The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
       :mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
       :hideous fate, can be heard.
#012722:The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
       :attempts to pass.
#012809:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
       :cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
       :are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
#012996:You are not equipped for an exorcism.
#013034:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
       :cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
       :of a greater power, flee through the walls.
#013199:You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
       :room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
       :sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
       :the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
       :adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
       :is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
#013565:Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
       :tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
#013671:You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
       :quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
       :to the north, south, east, and down.
#013837:The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
       :be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
       :the lake.
#013980:It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
       :the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing downstream
       :through the gates.
#014142:There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
       :panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
#014265:The green bubble is glowing.
#014294:The water level is now up to your ankles.
#014336:The water level is now up to your shins.
#014377:The water level is now up to your knees.
#014418:The water level is now up to your hips.
#014458:The water level is now up to your waist.
#014499:The water level is now up to your chest.
#014540:The water level is now up to your neck.
#014580:The water level is now over your head.
#014619:The water level is now high in your lungs.
#014662:The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
#014711:I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
#014754:You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
       :Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
#014878:The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
       :suddenly vanish.
#014958:Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
#015008:Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
       :smart thing to do, apparently.
#015102:You seem to be digging a hole here.
#015138:The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
#015187:You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
#015238:You can see a small statue in the sand.
#015278:The wall collapses, smothering you.
#015314:There is nothing to dig into here.
#015349:You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
#015391:You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
#015434:You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
#015474:This is getting you nowhere.
#015503:You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
       :drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
       :There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
#015693:A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
#015757:A solid rainbow spans the falls.
#015790:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
       :fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
       :of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
       :out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
#016039:You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
       :volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
       :below to the floor.
#016187:The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
#016230:There is a small door to the south.
#016266:You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
       :for an exit on the north side.
#016364:Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
       :the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
       :chipped out of the front of it.
#016517:On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
#016580:You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
       :There are exits to the east and southeast.
#016688:As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
#016739:The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
#016788:The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
#016837:The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
#016908:The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
#016964:The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
       :chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
       :ground.  Fatally.
#017117:The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
#017165:You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
       :that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
       :dungeon has collapsed.
#017323:The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
       :turning you into a pancake.
#017408:The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
       :turning you into a pancake.
#017503:A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
       :"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
       :trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
       :You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
#017766:Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
       :seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
       :voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
       :have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
       :all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
       :He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
       :wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
#018225:Problem reports and suggestions may currently be forwarded to:
       :		https://github.com/LydiaMarieWilliamson/zork-fortran
       :This is subject to future change.
#018377:Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
#018437:The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
       :at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
#018559:The lid opens.
#018574:The lid closes.
#018590:Look around.
#018603:You think it isn't?
#018623:I think you've already done that.
#018657:The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
       :attempt by robbers to remove it).
#018761:The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
#018808:The basket is at the other end of the chain.
#018853:A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
#018895:The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
#018955:The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
#019013:It is not tied to anything.
#019041:There is nothing it can be tied to.
#019077:The rope is already attached.
#019107:The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
#019176:I see no objects here.
#019199:Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
#019256:The rope drops gently to the floor below.
#019298:The rope is tied to the railing.
#019331:The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
#019396:The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
       :notice an irregularity beneath it.
#019491:The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
#019541:With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
       :With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
#019671:Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
       :to move it again.
#019748:You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
#019793:Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
#019849:The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
       :an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
#019971:Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
       :than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
#020097:There is an explosion nearby.
#020127:The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
#020164:The match has gone out.
#020188:The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
#020227:The lamp is dying.
#020246:The candles grow short.
#020270:The candles are very short.
#020298:The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
#020352:The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
       :the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
#020469:As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
       :of blinding blue light.
#020557:As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
       :overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
       :is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
       :savagely cuts your throat.
#020782:A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
       :of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
       :all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
       :the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
#021027:There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
#021094:There is an ugly person staring at you.
#021134:The mirror is broken into many pieces.
#021173:Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
#021240:You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
       :good luck available.
#021330:Haven't you done enough already?
#021363:The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
       :devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
       :downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
       :there is a passageway leading west.
#021599:The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
       :you in the dark.
#021682:The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
#021733:Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
#021799:burned out ivory torch
#021822:There is a burned out ivory torch here.
#021862:The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
#021908:The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
#021958:The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
#022007:You seem unable to affect these spirits.
#022048:How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
#022099:The book is open to page 569.
#022129:As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
#022176:A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
       :have turned into a pile of dust.
#022273:I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
#022318:One of the matches starts to burn.
#022353:The match is out.
#022371:The tube refuses to accept anything.
#022408:The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
#022465:The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
       :The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
#022588:The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
       :a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
       :gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
#022792:The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
       :put in that drink, anyway?).
#022889:The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
       :your generous gesture.
#022976:The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
#023025:The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
#023070:The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
#023107:The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
#023156:The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
#023217:The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
       :condiments for his upcoming snack.
#023322:The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
#023380:You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
#023431:Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
       :they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
#023558:The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
#023617:The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
#023687:You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
#023746:Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
       :tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
#023861:Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
       :artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
#023973:worthless piece of canvas
#023999:There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
#024042:With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
#024110:The window closes (more easily than it opened).
#024158:The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
#024201:The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
#024257:The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
#024325:You can't do that!
#024344:The grating is locked.
#024367:The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
#024412:The grating opens.
#024431:The grating is unlocked.
#024456:The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
       :into darkness.
#024539:The door swings shut and closes.
#024572:The door is locked from above.
#024603:The door cannot be opened.
#024630:You cannot burn this door.
#024657:The door is invulnerable.
#024683:You cannot damage this door.
#024712:The door is still under warranty.
#024746:The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
       :of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
       :excitement fades.
#024893:The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
#024942:A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
#024984:The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
       :"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
#025128:The lights within the room shut off.
#025165:The lights within the room come on.
#025201:Click.
#025208:There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
       :from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
       :in a pipe).
#025350:The blue button appears to be jammed.
#025388:The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
#025435:The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
#025476:You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
#025524:This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
#025587:Well done.  The boat is repaired.
#025621:There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
#025669:The boat deflates.
#025688:You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
#025735:The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
#025782:Very good.
#025793:The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
#025852:Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
       :walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
#025976:The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
       :precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
       :by water vapor.
#026119:The ballon is fastened to the hook.
#026155:The balloon is not tied to anything.
#026192:The wire falls off the hook.
#026221:The box is imbedded in the wall.
#026254:What do you expect, BOOM?
#026280:The box has no door!
#026301:The box is rusted and will not open.
#026338:The box is not open, chomper!
#026368:The wire starts to burn.
#026393:"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
       :# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
       :of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
       :sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
       :from sight.
#026652:"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
       :the # in his rock hard hands.
#026741:The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
#026781:Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
       :would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
       :prevent this.
#026925:Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
       :your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
       :of your life.
#027076:Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
       :for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
#027220:As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
       :to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
       :into the room.
#027367:As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
       :ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
       :Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
       :crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
#027619:There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
#027673:Nothing seems to happen.
#027698:The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
#027744:The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
#027790:A dull thump is heard in the distance.
#027829:The flask breaks into pieces.
#027859:Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
#027899:Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
       :flask's contents are fatal.
#027989:Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
#028043:The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
       :be clearly visible.
#028130:You can't see through that!
#028158:The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
#028217:The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
#028257:The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
#028299:The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
#028339:The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
#028401:The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
       :from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
       :with blasting cakes.
#028553:You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
#028611:The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
#028660:The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
       :that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
       :more or less demolished.
#028810:The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
       :floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
#028945:How romantic!
#028959:If you must... Poof, you're dead!
#028993:The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
       :earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
       :appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
       :seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
       :to tell the tale.
#029271:There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
       :the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
#029408:The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
#029446:The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
#029487:You notice that the # has burned out, and that
       :the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
#029572:I hope you have more light than from a #.
#029614:I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
       :# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
       :there is still justice in the world.
#029765:Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
       :gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
#029894:There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
#029940:The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
#029997:You won't melt it with a #.
#030025:The bolt can't be turned with your #.
#030063:It seems that a # won't do.
#030091:With a #?
#030101:The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
       :appendage in thanks.
#030173:A #?  Surely you jest.
#030196:He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
       :kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
#030318:You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
#030372:I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
#030422:At your service!
#030439:The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
#030508:Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
#030547:It could very well be too late.
#030579:The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
#030634:Naturally!
#030645:AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
#030675:Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
#030723:Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
#030771:Are you enjoying yourself?
#030798:Wheeeeee!
#030808:Do you expect me to applaud?
#030837:Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
#030892:You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
#030929:It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
#030983:Tough shit, asshole.
#031004:Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
#031067:That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
#031114:I think you are taking this thing for granite.
#031161:Brief descriptions.
#031181:Maximum verbosity.
#031200:No long descriptions.
#031222:You can see:  A #.
#031241:Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
#031282:I don't really see how.
#031306:I think that swimming is best performed in water.
#031356:Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
#031398:Wasn't he an Indian?
#031419:I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
       :barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
       :of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
#031615:Wasn't he a sailor?
#031635:The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
       :by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
#031760:There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
#031812:Well what?
#031823:If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
#031873:Nothing happens.
#031890:I don't really know how to do that.
#031926:Do you wish to leave the game?
#031957:Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
#032001:Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
#032043:Hello.
#032050:Good day.
#032060:Nice weather we've been having lately.
#032099:Goodbye.
#032108:Here, nothing happens.
#032131:Nothing happens here.
#032153:I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
#032200:You seem to be repeating yourself.
#032235:The # bows his head to you in greeting.
#032275:I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
#032326:It is impossible to read in the dark.
#032364:How does one look through a #?
#032395:How can I read a #?
#032415:How, exactly, do I ring that?
#032445:Ding, dong.
#032457:I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
#032494:If you wish, but I can't understand why.
#032535:Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
       :you want to brush them with.
#032624:A nice idea, but with a #?
#032651:Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
       :glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
       :and you die of respiratory failure.
#032820:Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
#032861:Inflating it further would probably burst it.
#032907:How can you inflate that?
#032933:Come on, now!
#032947:The # isn't sleeping.
#032969:This has no effect.
#032989:does not seem to do anything useful
#033025:is not notably useful
#033047:isn't very interesting
#033070:doesn't appear worthwhile
#033096:has no effect
#033110:doesn't do anything
#033130:Kicking a # #.
#033145:Waving a # #.
#033159:Playing in this way with a # #.
#033191:Fiddling with a # #.
#033212:Pushing the # #.
#033229:I don't think so.
#033247:This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
#033292:How can you tie that to anything?
#033326:You can't tie the # to that.
#033355:You could certainly never tie the # with that!
#033402:The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
#033445:Why would you tie up a #?
#033471:You can't turn that.
#033492:You certainly can't turn it with a #.
#033530:Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
#033570:Digging with a # is silly.
#033597:I don't think that anybody is home.
#033633:Why knock on a #?
#033651:It sounds like there is something inside the #.
#033699:The contents of the # spill out.
#033732:I can't get to that to move it.
#033764:You can't move the #.
#033786:You can't turn that on.
#033810:It is already on.
#033828:You can't turn that off.
#033853:It is already off.
#033872:The # is now on.
#033889:The # is now off.
#033907:It is now pitch black.
#033930:You must tell me how to do that to a #.
#033970:The # cannot be opened.
#033994:Opened.
#034002:Opening the # reveals:
#034025:The # cannot be closed.
#034049:It is already open.
#034069:It is already closed.
#034091:Closed.
#034099:There is a # here.
#034118:You are carrying a #.
#034140:It is in the #, which is in the room.
#034178:It is in the #, which you are carrying.
#034218:Time passes...
#034233:The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
#034276:I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
#034321:You are already in the #, cretin!
#034355:You are now in the #.
#034377:You aren't in that!
#034397:You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
       :be fatal.
#034472:You are on your own feet again.
#034504:You can't go there without a vehicle.
#034542:You can't go there in a #.
#034569:I see nothing special about the #.
#034604:It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
#034661:You are in the #.
#034679:The # has died.
#034695:The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
       :the guttural tongue of the trolls.
#034794:The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
       :bloody axe.
#034864:An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
       :of the room are open.
#034951:A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
       :out of the room.
#035037:The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
#035090:The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
#035152:The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
#035191:The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
#035247:The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
#035311:and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
#035377:and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
       :troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
       :not look pleased.
#035528:Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
#035560:You can't take the #.
#035582:Aren't you forgetting something?
#035615:That would be a good trick.
#035643:The # is too big to jump over.
#035674:You should have looked before you leaped.
#035716:I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
#035773:In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
#035838:Geronimo...
#035850:I don't think that the # would agree with you.
#035897:I think you should get that first.
#035932:Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
#035978:How can I drink that?
#036000:I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
#036038:Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
       :this talking.
#036114:The # catches fire.
#036134:Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
#036182:You don't have that.
#036203:The # catches fire and is consumed.
#036239:I don't think you can burn a #.
#036271:It doesn't seem to work.
#036296:Can you unlock a grating with a #?
#036331:Munging a # #.
#036346:Trying to kill a # #.
#036368:Trying to attack a # #.
#036392:There is nothing here to attack.
#036425:I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
#036471:with your bare hands is suicidal
#036504:with that is very self-destructive
#036539:You are in perfect health.
#036566:You have a light wound.
#036590:You have a serious wound.
#036616:You have several wounds.
#036641:You have serious wounds.
#036666:You are at death's door.
#036691:You can be killed by one more light wound.
#036734:You can be killed by a serious wound.
#036772:You can survive one serious wound.
#036807:You are strong enough to take several wounds.
#036853:You have been killed once.
#036880:You have been killed twice.
#036908:This gives you the rank of Cheater.
#036944:This gives you the rank of Wizard.
#036979:This gives you the rank of Master.
#037014:This gives you the rank of Winner.
#037049:This gives you the rank of Hacker.
#037084:This gives you the rank of Adventurer.
#037123:This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.
#037169:This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.
#037215:This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.
#037262:This gives you the rank of Beginner.
#037299:Your sword is no longer glowing.
#037332:Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
#037378:You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
#037421:Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
       :neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
#037531:The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
       :recovers his stilletto.
#037617:His booty remains.
#037636:As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
       :treasures reappear:  A #.
#037723:  A #.
#037730:There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
       :against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
#037860:There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
       :ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
#037980:The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
       :when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
#038098:Once you got him, what would you do with him?
#038144:You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
       :it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
       :seem angered by your attempt.
#038309:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
#038382:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
       :but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
#038502:Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
#038556:The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
       :stupid as you are?
#038644:The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
#038703:The candles are not lit.
#038728:The flame is extinguished.
#038755:Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
       :burn.
#038830:With what?
#038841:The candles are lit.
#038862:The candles are already lit.
#038891:You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
#038955:You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
#039014:The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
#039084:Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
#039148:Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
#039215:You can't go that way.
#039238:The # is closed.
#039255:I can't reach that.
#039275:You aren't carrying that.
#039301:Dropped.
#039310:Thrown.
#039318:You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
#039357:The balloon has landed.
#039381:You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
#039431:You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
#039473:The balloon descends.
#039495:You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
#039565:Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
       :causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
#039698:You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
#039739:The balloon ascends.
#039760:You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
       :due to its light load.
#039855:The balloon leaves the ledge.
#039885:You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
#039928:The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
#039970:The cloth bag is draped over the side.
#040009:The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
       :in the receptacle.
#040078:The balloon is tied to the hook.
#040111:I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
#040165:You are tied to the ledge.
#040192:You don't really want to hold a burning #.
#040235:The receptacle is already occupied.
#040271:The # burns inside the receptacle.
#040306:The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
#040353:Not likely.
#040365:An interesting idea, but...
#040393:A valiant attempt.
#040412:You can't be serious.
#040434:Not a prayer.
#040448:You already have it.
#040469:Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
#040535:Taken.
#040542:Nice try.
#040552:I can't do that.
#040569:I can't reach inside.
#040591:How can you do that?
#040612:The # is already in the #.
#040639:It won't fit.
#040653:I can't reach the #.
#040674:The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
#040721:"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
#040790:"My vision is not that good without eyes."
#040833:"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
#040893:ECHO
       :The acoustics of the room change subtly.
#040939:Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
       :sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
       :carcass has disappeared.
#041081:The # contains:
#041097:Your collection of treasures consists of:
#041139:You are carrying:
#041157:The # is carrying:
#041176:By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
       :stop the leak in the dam.
#041259:You are empty handed.
#041281:It is too dark in here to see.
#041312:#:
#041315:I could't find anything.
#041340:I couldn't find any valuables.
#041371:Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
       :walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
       :the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
#041555:Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
       :valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
       :nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
#041752:The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
       :Fortunately, he took nothing.
#041840:A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
       :nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
#041941:A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
       :the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
       :room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
       :others before...".
#042160:The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
       :left disgusted.
#042244:The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
       :have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
#042355:Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
       :fine # is doing here?"
#042447:You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
       :ineffective.
#042523:Attacking a dead # is pointless.
#042556:Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
#042613:The # slowly regains his feet.
#042644:The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
#042695:It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
       :that you are dead.
#042778:Saved.
#042785:I can't access the save file.
#042815:Restored.
#042825:Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
#042876:I don't understand that.
#042901:You cannot talk to that!
#042926:You cannot talk through another person.
#042966:Please input the entire command again.
#043005:Fortunately, you still have a #.
#043038:You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
       :leading up.
#043115:A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
       :adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
       :and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
       :friendly, though he likes people.
#043335:The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
       :think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
       :a cyclops.
#043481:The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
       :His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
#043603:The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
       :blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
#043708:On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
       :now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
#043814:The bottle is closed.
#043836:The bottle is already full.
#043864:The bottle is now full of water.
#043897:The water slips through your fingers.
#043935:Too many prepositions.
#043958:Too many objects.
#043976:I can't see one here.
#043998:Which one do you mean?
#044021:I can't reach that from inside the #.
#044059:What should I do with the #?
#044088:Huh?
#044093:You must supply a direct object.
#044126:You must supply an indirect object.
#044162:Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
       :abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
       :Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
#044339:The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
       :your greeting with his usual graciousness.
#044451:The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
       :the # and stops to admire its beauty.
#044556:The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
#044606:The # is empty.
#044622:I don't know how to look inside a #.
#044659:There is nothing interesting there.
#044695:The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
#044755:You can't wind a #.
#044775:You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
#044829:A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
       :in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
       :surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
       :brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
#045086:An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
       :safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
       :forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
       :box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
       :here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
       :askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
#045472:The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
       :you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
       :leaving you alone in the bare room.
#045642:Talk about eating rich foods!
#045672:Nothing like having money to burn!
#045707:"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
       :disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
       :understated "pop".
#045863:The gnome carefully places the # in the
       :deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
       :that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
       :disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
#046118:The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
       :fingers, leaving you alone.
#046213:The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
#046255:There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
#046317:The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
#046384:The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
       :From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
       :limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
       :a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
       :of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
       :down, the song bird flies away.
#046759:The cliff is too steep for climbing.
#046796:The egg is already open.
#046821:There is no obvious way to open the egg.
#046862:I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
#046909:The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
       :seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
#047011:The concept of using a # is certainly original.
#047059:Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
#047110:You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
       :The egg is now open.
#047200:Climbing the walls is of no avail.
#047235:Bizarre!
#047244:The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
#047298:The # falls to the ground.
#047325:You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
       :branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
#047452:On the ground below you can see:
#047485:I can't see any wall here.
#047512:That cannot be turned.
#047535:You would be lost without me.
#047565:You don't have the #.
#047587:The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
#047641:I can't see any song bird here.
#047673:You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
#047726:You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
#047784:You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
#047837:That would involve quite a contortion!
#047876:You are in it, turkey!
#047899:As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
#047945:The # goes through it.
#047968:The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
#048012:The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
#048063:I can't do that with everything at once.
#048104:There is a wall there.
#048127:There is no way up.
#048147:There is no way down.
#048169:You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
       :dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
       :In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
       :which is engraved a compass rose.
#048409:Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
       :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
       :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
       :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
       :around formidable bludgeons.
#048710:Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
       :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
       :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
       :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
       :around formidable bludgeons.
#049011:A passage enters from the south.
#049044:The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
       :their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
#049165:To the north and south are large hallways.
#049208:To the north is a large hallway.
#049241:You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
       :complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
       :is open.
       :   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
       :carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
       :is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
       :half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
       :opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
       :black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
       :the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
       :   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
       :deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
       :exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
       :depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
       :area is a compass rose.
       :   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
       :is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
       :in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
       :in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
       :(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
       :pole.
       :   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
#050545:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
       :the stone floor.
#050631:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
       :dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
#050742:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
       :out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
       :friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
#050932:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
       :dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.
#051049:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
       :above the stone channel in the floor.
#051156:   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
       :through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
       :bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
       :attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
       :T-bar are pointing #.

#051502:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
       :and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
       :end, inches above the floor.
#051667:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
       :and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
       :end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
       :room by a # lying on the floor.
#051904:Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
       :sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
       :this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
       :the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
       :crypt to the south.  The door is #.
#052209:You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
       :and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
       :additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
#052398:In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
       :which is #.
#052474:You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
       :and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
#052607:You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
#052675:The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
       :panel is #, and the door is #.
#052774:You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
       :parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
       :towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
       :ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
       :window barred with iron.  The door is #.
#053086:You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
       :parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
       :smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
       :bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
       :is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
       :two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
       :so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
       :   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
       :an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
       :of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
       :to the number "#".

#053780:five
#053785:six
#053789:seven
#053795:eight
#053801:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
       :and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
       :in front of you.
#053951:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
       :corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
#054071:Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
#054120:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
       :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
       :its small window.
#054272:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
       :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
       :its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
       :which seems to be #.
#054493:   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
       :master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
       :solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
       :your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
       :waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
       :lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
       :You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
       :moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
       :treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
       :and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
#055152:Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
       :disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
       :As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
       :and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
       :Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
       :future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
       :transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
       :	INCANT, <word>
       :and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
       :	INCANT, <phrase>
       :Good luck, and choose wisely!"
#055727:The button pops back to its original position.
#055774:The mirror quietly swings shut.
#055806:The pine wall closes quietly.
#055836:The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
#055884:The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
#055937:The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
#055989:The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
#056036:The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
#056098:The pine wall swings open.
#056125:The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
#056186:The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
       :budge.
#056258:The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
#056318:The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
#056379:The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
#056438:The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
       :suspicions are aroused.
#056523:Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
       :them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
       :the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
       :resume their posts.
#056745:A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
       :are aroused.
#056828:Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
       :Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
       :they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
#057010:The statues are impassive.
#057037:The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
       :blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
       :his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
       :completes you crumble into dust.
#057270:"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
#057334:The pole is now slightly above the floor.
#057376:The pole cannot be raised further.
#057411:The pole cannot be lowered further.
#057447:The pole is lowered into the channel.
#057485:The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
#057526:The pole is already resting on the floor.
#057568:The pole now rests on the stone floor.
#057607:The button becomes depressed.
#057637:The button pops back out.
#057663:The button is already depressed.
#057696:No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
#057745:The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
#057800:You can't break the beam with a #.
#057835:The # already breaks the beam.
#057866:I see no bronze door here.
#057893:The bronze door opens.
#057916:The bronze door closes.
#057940:On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
       :into a larger area.
#058026:The door won't budge.
#058048:The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
       :will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
       :panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
       :old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
       :   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
       :that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
       :admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
       :you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
       :Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
       :one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
       :discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
       :Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
       :attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
       :admit you to these regions.
       :   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
#058984:The booming voice asks:
#059008:"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
       :through the cyclops room?"
#059104:"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
#059176:"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
       :treasures, in Zorkmids?"
#059262:"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
#059333:"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"
#059382:"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
#059431:"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
#059472:"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
#059525:The door is securely fastened.
#059556:The wooden door opens.
#059579:The wooden door closes.
#059603:The dungeon master says, "I will stay."
#059643:The dungeon master says, "I will follow."
#059685:There is no reply.
#059704:"I prefer to stay where I am, thank you."
#059746:"I am not permitted to enter the prison cell."
#059793:"I cannot perform that action for you."
#059833:This gives you the rank of Dungeon Master.
#059876:This gives you the rank of Super Cheater.
#059918:This gives you the rank of Master Cheater.
#059961:This gives you the rank of Advanced Cheater.
#060006:You are in the Tomb of the Unknown Implementer.  A hollow voice
       :says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
       :In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
       :is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
       :headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
       :cryptic inscription:
       :
       :		"Feel Free".
#060348:The door of the crypt is extremely heavy, but it opens easily.
#060411:The crypt is already open.
#060438:The crypt is already closed.
#060467:The crypt is closed.
#060488:The dial spins and comes to a stop pointing at "#".
#060540:There is no answer.
#060560:No one seems to be listening.
#060590:The dungeon master says, "Excellent."
#060628:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have four more chances."
#060699:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have three more chances."
#060771:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have two more chances."
#060841:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong.  You have one more chance."
#060910:The mirror is closed.
#060932:You must specify what to set the dial to.
#060974:The dial face contains only numbers.
#061011:The dial now points to "#".
#061039:The button depresses with a slight click and pops back.
#061095:The cell door is now closed.
#061124:You notice that the dungeon master does not follow.
#061176:The dungeon master catches up with you.
#061216:The dungeon master follows you.
#061248:There is a wooden wall blocking your way.
#061290:There is a large mirror blocking your way.
#061333:There is a large broken mirror blocking your way.
#061383:The structure blocks your way.
#061414:As you leave, the door swings shut.
#061450:You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large mirror.
#061510:You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large mirror.
#061570:You are in a narrow room whose west wall is a large wooden panel
       :which once contained a mirror.
#061666:You are in a narrow room whose east wall is a large wooden panel
       :which once contained a mirror.
#061762:The mirror is mounted on a panel which has been opened outward.
#061826:The panel has been opened outward.
#061861:The opposite wall is solid rock.
#061894:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
       :obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
       :and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
       :With that, he departs.
#062115:The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
       :master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
       :wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.
#062309:Saves are not permitted during the endgame.
#062353:Restores are not permitted during the endgame.
#062400:The structure rotates clockwise.
#062433:The structure rotates counterclockwise.
#062473:I can't see a mirror here.
#062500:I don't see any way to open the mirror here.
#062545:The mirror breaks, revealing a panel behind it.
#062593:The mirror has already been broken.
#062629:The mirror is mounted on a wooden panel which moves slightly inward
       :as you push and back out as you let go.  The mirror feels rather
       :fragile.
#062771:The mirror is unyielding but seems rather fragile.
#062822:I can't see a panel here.
#062848:I don't see any way to open the panel here.
#062892:To break the panel you would have to break the mirror first.
#062953:The panel is not that easily destroyed.
#062993:The wooden panel moves slightly inward as you push and back out
       :when you let go.
#063074:The panel is unyielding.
#063099:A disheveled adventurer stares back at you.
#063143:The mirror is broken into little pieces.
#063184:Shards of a broken mirror are dangerous to play with.
#063238:The # side of the room is divided by a wooden wall into small
#063300:hallways to the #east and #west.
#063333:A large mirror fills the # side of the hallway.
#063381:A large panel fills the # side of the hallway.
#063428:The shattered pieces of a mirror cover the floor.
#063478:The corridor continues north.
#063508:The corridor continues south.
#063538:The corridor continues north and south.
#063578:Incantations are useless once you have gotten this far.
#063634:That incantation seems to have been a failure.
#063681:Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
#063724:That spell has no obvious effect.
#063758:As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
       :envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.
#063878:The structure won't budge.
#063905:You are in a room with an exit to the north and a steel door to the east.
#063979:You are in a room with an exit to the north and a passage to the east.
#064050:The card slides easily into the slot and vanishes, and the steel
       :door slides open, revealing a passageway to the west.  A moment
       :later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
       :	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"
#064281:The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
       :unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
       :now atomized, spews through the slot.
#064437:I can't see any ladder here.

       :The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
       :descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
       :grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
       :and marble.  The following notations will be used:
       :			..  = current position (middle of grid)
       :			MM  = marble wall

#073642:You are in a narrow east-west passageway.  There is a narrow staircase
       :leading down at the north end of the room.
#073756:You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded
       :front door.
#073834:You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,
       :and all the windows are barred.
#073938:You are facing the south side of a white house.  There is no door here,
       :and all the windows are barred.
#074042:You are in the attic.  The only exit is stairs that lead down.
#074105:You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.
       :Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.
#074237:You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
#074293:Dead end.
#074303:You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
#074365:You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the
       :east, there appears to be sunlight.
#074469:You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One
       :particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
#074594:You are in a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except
       :to the east, where a small clearing may be seen.
#074710:You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
       :Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
       :descends.
#074857:You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
       :is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages
       :can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.
#075066:You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path
       :travels to the north and the east.
#075170:You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
       :to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
       :walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.
#075353:You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an
       :ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.
#075484:You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.
       :To the south and west are small passageways.
#075597:You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are
       :exits to the southeast and upward.
#075701:You are on the south edge of a deep canyon.  Passages lead off
       :to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
       :flowing water below.
#075847:You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
       :the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone
       :stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it
       :is difficult to hear yourself think.
#076090:You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
       :leading down.
#076173:You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
       :forbidding staircase leading down.
#076274:You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to
       :the south and southwest.
#076370:You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
       :However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
#076504:You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
       :intersects with a northward path.
#076608:You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit
       :on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be
       :heard faintly to the north.
#076769:You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
       :coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
       :WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
       :there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
       :of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
       :north is a small opening.
#077130:You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
       :mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
       :and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
#077319:You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
       :from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
#077456:You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
       :descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
       :the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
       :shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
#077725:You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
       :the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
       :paths running west and northeast.
#077894:You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
       :of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
       :east is a narrow path.
#078053:You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
#078112:You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden
       :ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is
       :also a staircase leading upward.
#078276:You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
#078323:You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a
       :narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages
       :leaving the room.
#078471:You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
       :timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the
       :southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
#078663:You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
       :shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
       :passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
#078853:You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
       :There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
#078992:You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
       :seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
       :passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
#079199:You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
#079268:A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
       :path exits to the south and to the east.
#079379:You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
       :the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
       :damp here.
#079526:A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
       :cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
#079641:You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
#079708:This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
       :To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
       :following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
       :solving this riddle--
       :	What is tall as a house,
       :	Round as a cup,
       :	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
#080019:This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
#080087:You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
       :stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
#080215:You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
       :ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
       :The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
       :room is through huge marble pillars.
#080459:You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
       :appears to be an altar.
#080551:This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
       :the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
       :"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
#080742:You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
       :control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
       :room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
       :the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
       :panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
       :different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
       :room are in the west and south ends.
#081189:You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
       :east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
       :cyclops sized).
#081335:This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
       :of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
       :on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
       :created passage to the east.
#081567:You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
       :and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
       :Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
       :northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
       :extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
       :you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
       :could get back down.
#081995:You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
       :have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
       :left through the north, south, or west exits.
#082172:You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
       :and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
       :river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
       :from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
       :way downstream.
#082465:You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
       :flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
#082591:The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
       :dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
       :prevent landing on the west.
#082744:The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
       :the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
       :may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
#082945:You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
       :white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
       :along the cliffs.
#083096:You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
       :narrow path leads north along the shore.
#083201:The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
       :that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
       :area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
#083387:The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
       :shore is a large landing area.
#083485:You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
       :treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
       :quickly turning around a sharp corner.
#083659:You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
       :flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
#083795:You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
       :to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
#083910:You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
#083978:You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
       :barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
#084078:You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
       :on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
       :travels east-west here.
#084236:You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
       :past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
       :cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
       :above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
       :continues to the southeast.
#084537:You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
       :here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
       :runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
#084733:You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
       :You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
       :along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
       :canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
       :climbable.
#085005:You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
       :there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
       :upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
       :appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
       :northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
       :Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
       :top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
       :west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
       :around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
#085602:You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
       :light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
       :exit here is to the north.
#085762:You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
       :top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
#085875:You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
       :above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
       :west side.
#086015:You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
       :the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
       :east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
#086213:You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
       :across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
#086349:You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
       :volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
       :floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
#086551:You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
       :the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
       :A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
       :it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
       :those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
#086878:You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
       :for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
       :to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
#087070:You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
       :There are exits here to the west and the south.
#087187:You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
       :smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
       :sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
       :which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
       :above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
       :above all the buttons says in English:
       :
       :		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
       :
       :There are exits to the west and the south.
#087638:You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
       :is a small sticker which reads:
       :
       :		Protected by
       :		  FROBOZZ
       :	     Magic Alarm Company
       :	      (Hello, footpad!).
#087819:You are trapped inside an steel cage.
#087857:You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
       :the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
       :entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
#088056:You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
       :mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
       :some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
#088257:You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
       :oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
       :objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
       :corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
       :There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
#088593:You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
       :posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
       :be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
       :abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
       :chasm on the west and the northwest.
#088899:You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
       :large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
       :falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
#089085:You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
       :banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
       :account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
       :the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
       :less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
       :"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
       :Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
       :that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
       :the room, which say
       :
       :	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
#089667:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
       :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
       :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
       :On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
       :
       :		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
#089963:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
       :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
       :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
       :On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
       :
       :		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
#090259:You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
       :their contents.  On the north side of the room is a sign which says
       :
       :   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
       :    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
       :     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
       :      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
       :               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
#090698:You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
       :are no exits from this room.
#090796:You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
#090867:You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
       :were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
       :all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
       :and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
       :of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
       :room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
       :the side of the cube is some lettering.
#091307:This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
       :Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
       :The lone exit is to the north.
#091463:You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
       :a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
       :passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
#091654:You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
       :south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illuminated
       :by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
       :is a red button.
#091866:You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
       :widens into larger areas as it turns east at its northern and
       :southern ends.
#092007:You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
       :widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
       :southern ends.
#092148:You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
       :in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
       :contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
       :   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
       :zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
       :   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
       :as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
       :the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
       :other informative and inspiring works.
       :   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
       :Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
       :and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
       :   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
       :certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
       :International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
       :of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
#093115:You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
       :created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
       :feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There
       :are exits to the west and south.

#103124:At the end of the rainbow is a pot of gold.
#103168:A sharp stick, which appears to have been broken at one end, is here.
#103238:On the floor is a gold zorkmid coin (a valuable collector's item).
#103305:The excessively gaudy crown of Lord Dimwit Flathead is here.
#103366:There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced
       :by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.
#103498:There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the
       :paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be
       :distinguished now.
#103648:On the floor sit 200 neatly stacked zorkmid bills.
#103699:A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
#103753:On the branch is a small birds nest.
#103790:In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,
       :apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is
       :covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and
       :mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a
       :delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely
       :fragile.
#104131:There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It has ruby
       :eyes and a silver beak.  Through a crystal window below its left
       :wing you can see intricate machinery inside.  It appears to have
       :wound down.
#104341:There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It seems to
       :have recently had a bad experience.  The mountings for its jewel-like
       :eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled.  Through a cracked
       :crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of
       :intricate machinery.  It is not clear what result winding it would
       :have, as the mainspring appears sprung.
#104716:Nestled inside the niche is an engraved gold card.
#104767:The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
       :an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
       :ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
       :are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
       :texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
       :to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
#105181:The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
       :remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
       :be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects,
       :absent-mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
       :final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
       :dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
       :Zorkers were obscure indeed.
#105593:		Commandment #12592
       :Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":
       :Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
       :Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
       :Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
       :Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
       :Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
       :unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
       :Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

       :		Flood Control Dam #3
       :
       :  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
       :Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
       :Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
       :zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
       :tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
       :is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
       :center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
       :the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
       :square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
       :
       :  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
       :the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
       :drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
       :tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
       :bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
       :12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
       :processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

       :  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
       :FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

       :
       :		--- LATE NEWS FLASH!! ---
       :
       :The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
       :There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.
       :
       :		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---
       :
       :This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
       :reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
       :at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
       :parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
       :is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.
       :
       :This version was upgraded from FORTRAN-IV to FORTRAN 77 and then
       :later converted C via f77. It was later upgraded to ensure
       :compatibility with Fortran 2018 and re-converted in tandem to C99,
       :also via f77, with the earlier C version upgraded to C99 and brought
       :into line with the more recent version.
       :
       :This version is currently being maintained on GitHub at
       :		https://github.com/LydiaMarieWilliamson/zork-fortran
       :where problems may be reported. This is subject to future change.

       :
       :Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
       :to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
       :I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
       :
       :Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
       :forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
       :future and make really big Zorkmids."
       :
       :MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
       :you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

#109100:		    Welcome to Dungeon!
       :
       :   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
       :you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
       :man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
       :within.
       :
       :   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
       :of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
       :vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
       :fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
       :
       :   No DECsystem should be without one!
       :
       :   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
       :Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
       :Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
       :Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
       :and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
       :The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
       :a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
       :and was later translated to C and then updated to C99.

       :in the chamber to which this passage leads have no basis in fact.

       :be quite impossible for you to exit.

       :				Sincerely yours,
