This is a Fortran version of the source code for Zork, based ultimately on the original translation to Fortran from MDL.
It has been updated to make it compatible with Fortran 2018 and to remove some of its bugs.
Further details on this may be found in ‟History”.

In addition, a new translation into C99, separate from the 1991 C translation described in ‟History”, is in the C2021 subdirectory,
an update of the 1991 C translation is under C1991, with some of the bugs, that it inherited from the Fortran version, removed.

The Makefile provided here (which subsumes the one described below) is set up for a linux::gfortran configuration.
No additional measures have yet been added for the ‟GDB” in-program debugger, and it's possible that none may be.
Script file inputs and outputs may be added to be used for regression testing.

In addition, the readit.c program (described below) may be replaced by an actual glossary listing
and/or (de)compiler for the *.dat files.
As with other games, this contains the architecture of an entire world in it ...
but also some fixed parameters that best belong in the source code files, instead.

The first README addenda
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
From Tom Almy:

Running dungeon
───────────────
Run dungeon (also known as "ZORK") from the directory containing the *.dat files.

This "mainframe zork" has everything contained in the commercial ZORK I, part of ZORK II, and the endgame from ZORK III.
Some mainframe computers don't have this full version, so if your mainframe doesn't have the endgame,
the bank of zork, and the puzzle room, you are in for some new challenges.

BTW, the source files say copyright INFOCOM, but allow non-commercial use.
This was the last version before INFOCOM went commercial.

Compiling dungeon
─────────────────
The makefile will make dungeon.exe from the sources.

You will need:
∙	A UNIX like make (I use Don Kneller's NDMAKE)
∙	Microsoft Fortran (versions 4 and 5 tested)

I modified the sources only slightly from the distribution I received (which was intended for the VAX).
Changes made:
∙	INCLUDE statement syntax different
∙	Continuation character moved from column 1 to 6 (boy is the VAXUNIX wierd!)
∙	Bitwise logical function names changed.
∙	GDT command always available if compiled with debug code present (see Makefile for instructions).

All pretty trivial.

Also, the program readit (compiled from readit.c) will allow printing out all the text strings in the game.
This is useful for the cheaters among you, particularly those compiling in the GDT command. :-)

The original README
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This is a source file distribution for the game dungeon as implemented in f77 for Unix(R) systems.
It is based on the game dungeon as distributed on a DECUS tape, circa 1980.
It has been converted from the original DEC FORTRAN into something that is palatable to Unix f77.
See the file ‟History” for some revision history and credit to those whose efforts have made this possible.

Branch Note: this branch of Zork is being used as a starting point
for translation C using a more up-to-date Fortran-to-C translator;
and will be subject to a round of major recoding to bring it up to sync
with our locally-maintained version of both this branch and the C branch.
Both will be merged.

Checkout the Makefile and adjust it to fit your system.
The only things that should really need tweaking are the directory definitions and the ‟-D” defines.
There is an example for both large address machines (e.g. Vax) that get the complete game
and small address machines (e.g. Pdp-11) that get a modified game with minor functionality missing (to get it to fit).
Also edit the include file ‟files.h” if necessary.

All of the f77 files end in a '.f' extension to force f77 to invoke the C preprocessor for the #include files and #ifdefs.
Most of the #ifdefs are for the PDP version (default non-pdp) and for debug (default off).

Except for dtext.dat, all files in the distribution kit are ASCII.
dtext.dat is a binary file consisting of 76-byte fixed length records.

This has been compiled and tested on a PDP-11/44 Version 7, PDP-11/70 2.9bsd Vax-11/785 4.3bsd and Sun-3
before the pdp and Vax sources were merged (see the file ‟History”).
After the merge it was again tested on the Vax 11-785 4.3bsd.

I/we consider my/our changes to be in the public domain.
The original source, however, is copyright.
