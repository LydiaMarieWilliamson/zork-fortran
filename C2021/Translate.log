The results of translation from Fortran into C by f2c.

Addenda (2021/09/17-2021/09/18):
	The original Fortran source was a translation from MDL and contains translation errors in blkdata.f.
	The encodings used for data initialization are in base 40 with:
		‟1Rα”: 1600a,
		‟2Rαβ”: 1600a + 40b,
		‟3Rαβγ”: 1600a + 40b + c
	where
		(α,a), (β,b), (γ,c) ∈ { (' ',0), ('A',1), ⋯, ('Z',26), ('$',27), ('.',28), ('%',29), ('0',30), ('1',31), ⋯, ('9',39) }
	which comprise the digits of the MOD40 representation of base-40 numerals;
	a version of RADIX50 specialized for PDP-11/VAX. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_RADIX_50#16-bit_systems

	In blkdata.f, there were mismatches in the following places:
	∙	(1RS, 29560): Mismatched value (it should be 30400); 29560 corresponds to 2RRS.
	∙	(3RPAP, 256656): Mismatched value (it should be 25656).
	∙	(1RO, 0): Mismatched value (it should be 24000).
	∙	(1RY, 4000): Mismatched value (it should be 40000).
	∙	(3RMIN, 21175): Mismatched value (it should be 21174).

	The first two of these inconsistencies were corrected by the 1991 translation to C,
	and have been repaired here - both in the Fortran original and the new C translation.
	The ‟1RS” in (1RS, 29560) was already changed to ‟2RRS”.
	This involved words starting in ‟HOURS⋯”, but did not affect them, since the mistake was in the comment, not the code.
	The 256656 in (3RPAP, 256656) was already changed to 25656, is for words beginning in ‟PAPER⋯” and affects the code.

	The remaining inconsistencies, which affect words that start in ‟INTO⋯”, ‟CLAY⋯”, ‟CRIMIN⋯”, respectively,
	and have all been inherited by the translations of Zork into C.
	They were repaired in a later revision (2021/09/30).

The following note (up to layout changes) was inserted by f2c into the translated files, but has been moved here:

	Translated by f2c (version 20190311).
	You must link the resulting object file with libf2c:
	∙	on Microsoft Windows system, link with libf2c.lib;
	∙	on Linux or Unix systems, link with .../path/to/libf2c.a -lm
	∙	or, if you install libf2c.a in a standard place, with -lf2c -lm
	-- in that order, at the end of the command line, as in
		cc *.o -lf2c -lm
	Source for libf2c is in /netlib/f2c/libf2c.zip, e.g.,
		http://www.netlib.org/f2c/libf2c.zip

as well as the following include:

	#include "f2c.h"

which was changed to

	#include "F2C.h"

with the system ‟f2c.h” directly added here and internalized as ‟F2C.h”, where it was whittled away.
The system-dependent part of the original ‟f2c.h” had already been removed from ‟F2C.h”, since it's not used anywhere.
Most of the ‟Fortran”-isms had also been removed from ‟F2C.h” and rendered in native C.
The remnant of ‟F2C.h” has since been moved into ‟extern.h”.
