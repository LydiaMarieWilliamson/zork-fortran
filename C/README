This is a translation in progress into C of the Fortran source code in this archive,
carried out with the aid of version 20190311 of f2c.

A separate translation to C had been earlier done in 1991, using a less-developed version of f2c.
It is being used as a guide and cross-check for this translation.

History
───────
2021/09/14	The raw translation of the Fortran source into C, using f2c (version 20190311).
		Common Blocks are translated incorrectly and #include's are inserted in-line.
		All of that has to be fixed and undone.
		The file ‟Translate.log” contains some of the details provided by the translator.
2021/09/14	A first Makefile has been added.
		This assumes that the f2c library and the include file ‟f2c.h” have been installed
		The file ‟Compile.log” contains some of the details provided by the first run of ‟make”.
2021/09/14	The undefined function itime_() has been resolved with a ‟fallback” function ITime_().
2021/09/14	The ‟f2c.h” file has been internalized as ‟F2C.h”.
		Additional normalization has been done on the source code layout.
2021/09/14	Most of ‟F2C.h” has been nativized to C and eliminated.
2021/09/14	Move the declarations of ‟built-in” functions (defined in the f2c library) to "F2C.h".
		Further information on the f2c library and utility may be found in https://www.netlib.org/f2c/f2c.pdf.
2021/09/15	Collating the definitions of the common blocks into ‟common.c”.
2021/09/15	Eliminated the duplicate common block definitions from ‟common.c”.
		Compilation is now possible, but no baseline has yet been established.
		Hidden size-dependencies for data I/O exist, which crash the file I/O.
2021/09/15	Added the data/configuration files d{indx,text}.dat as symbolic links (for now).
2021/09/15	Normalized the layout of the comments.
2021/09/15	Strength reduction:
		∙	lifted input-only function parameters to value parameters.
		∙	lifted output-only parameters to return values, when singular.
		∙	commented out unused parameters.
		∙	eliminated ‟Void”, after reducing it to ‟void”.
		No effect on the compile-time or run-time baselines.
2021/09/16	Encapsulation of the f2c library in F2C.c; as a first step to nativizing and replacing it.
		The program crashes occur in the f2c library functions, and these need to be replaced and fixed.
2021/09/16	Elimination of static constant parameters.
2021/09/16	Collating the in-line inserted ‟include” files; in preparation of removing them back to include files.
2021/09/16	Regularized the translated copies of the ‟include” files and their common block and equivalence definitions.
2021/09/17	The in-line versions of ‟parser.h” have been regularized and extracted, first.
