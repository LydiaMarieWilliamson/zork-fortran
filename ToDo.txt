Pending reconciliations:
∙	rtext[] size, mmax: common.c, common.h, dinit.c, readit.c.
∙	Enabling flags: demons.c, dgame.c, dinit.c, dsub.c, Makefile, rtim.c, sverbs.c.
∙	The format of dindx.dat: dinit.c, extern.h, local.c, dindx.dat.
∙	The version numbering & game messages: dmain.c, rtim.c, Test.ex, Test.ex0, dtext.dat.
∙	The format of dtext.dat and the messaging routine: dsub.c, dtext.dat.
∙	The documentation: README
∙	Command-line arguments & settable random number seeds: Test.in, Test.ex, Test.ex0, Makefile, dinit.c (call to inirnd()).
Pending recoding ― for both the C and Fortran versions:
∙	Integration of Fortran version 3.2.
∙	Removal of system-generated locals.
∙	Synthesis of control-flow structures (note to The Translator: Fortran 77 has control-flow, e.g. SELECT CASE).
∙	Synthesis of data structures for the tables (note to The Translator: Fortran 77 has STRUCTURE).
∙	Lifting of structure indexes to structure pointers (note to The Translator: Fortran 77 has POINTER).
∙	Inclusion of a more comprehensive test suite.
∙	Inclusion of maps and other paraphenilia.
Longer-term items:
∙	Further translation to C++, so that equivalences can be more directly handled.
∙	Re-fitting of the terminal I/O to GUI I/O (possibly with QT ... which uses C++).
∙	Expansion and generalization of the natural language I/O.
∙	Translation to other languages.
∙	Dynamic worlds.
