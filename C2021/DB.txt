#0024:Useful commands:
     :
     :   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
     :for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
     :printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
     :command restores long descriptions.
     :   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
     :of what the game is about.
     :   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
     :to continue playing.
     :   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
     :   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
     :   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
     :   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
     :   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
     :   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
     :   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.
     :
     :Command abbreviations:
     :
     :   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
     :   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
     :   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.
     :
     :Containment:
     :
     :   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
     :be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
     :not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
     :which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
     :to see such an object, the container must be either open or
     :transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
     :the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
     :sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
     :in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
     :will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
     :process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
     :can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
     :one level down.
     :
     :Fighting:
     :
     :   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
     :attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
     :Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
     :etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
     :fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
     :getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
     :Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
     :fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
     :should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.
     :
     :Command parser:
     :
     :   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
     :For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
     :first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
     :'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
     :creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this truncation
     :may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.
     :
     :   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
     :the following types of things--
     :
     :   Actions:
     :	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
     :	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
     :	PUT DOWN, etc.
     :
     :   Directions:
     :	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
     :	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
     :	only certain situations.
     :
     :   Objects:
     :	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.
     :
     :   Adjectives:
     :	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
     :	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
     :	DOORs, BUTTONs).
     :
     :   Prepositions:
     :	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
     :	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
     :	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
     :	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
     :	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
     :	WITH DEMON' won't parse.
     :
     :   Sentences:
     :	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic constructions.
     :	In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
     :	can be placed on the same line.
     :
     :   Ambiguity:
     :	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
     :	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
     :	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
     :	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
     :	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
#0125:Welcome to Dungeon!
     :
     :   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
     :quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
     :In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
     :receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
     :case in the living room of the house.
     :
     :   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
     :which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
     :need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
     :since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
     :material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
     :is rumored to be useful.
     :
     :   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
     :When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
     :certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
     :the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
     :safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
     :addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
     :with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
     :which you may do only twice.
     :
     :   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
     :likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
     :light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
     :rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
     :you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
     :he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
     :his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally
     :stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
     :through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
#0158:Please answer the question.
#0159:You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
     :dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
     :installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
     :may gloat over them.
#0163:What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
     :RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
#0165:Now let me see...
     :Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
     :everything.
#0168:Do you wish me to try to patch you?
#0169:You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
     :there is a window which is #.
#0171:open
#0172:slightly ajar
#0173:You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
     :been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
     :the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
     :east is a small window which is #.
#0177:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
     :is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be
     :nailed shut.
#0180:You are in the living room.  There is a door to the east.  To the west
     :is a cyclops-shaped hole in an old wooden door, above which is some
     :strange gothic lettering.
#0183:In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.
#0184:In the center of the room is a closed trap door.
#0185:In the center of the room is an open trap door.
#0186:There is a rug lying next to an open trap door.
#0187:You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
     :east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
     :steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
#0190:The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
#0191:You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
     :passages in the immediate vicinity.
#0193:Above you is a grating locked with a skull-and-crossbones lock.
#0194:Above you is an open grating with sunlight pouring in.
#0195:Above you is a grating.
#0196:You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west
     :and south.
#0198:There is a grating securely fastened into the ground.
#0199:There is an open grating descending into darkness.
#0200:A grating appears on the ground.
#0201:You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
#0202:You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
     :reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
     :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#0205:There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
     :climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
#0207:You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
     :Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
     :cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
#0210:You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
     :large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
#0212:You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
#0213:You are in a large cavernous room, to the south of which was formerly
     :a reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
     :a wide stream running through the center of the room.
#0216:There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
#0217:You are in a large room with giant icicles hanging from the walls
     :and ceiling.  There are passages to the north and east.
#0219:Part of the glacier has been melted.
#0220:There is a large passageway leading westward.
#0221:You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
     :on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
     :an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
#0224:Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
     :actions.
#0226:		BOOOOOOOOOM
#0227:You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
     :corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
     :dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
     :obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
     :label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manipulable
     :by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
     :inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
#0234:closed
#0235:The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
#0236:You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
#0237:In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
     :is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
#0239:A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
     :from the ceiling and lifts you away...
#0241:You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
     :of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
     :wooden railing which circles the dome.
#0244:Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
     :from the floor below.
#0246:I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
#0247:You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
     :staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
     :large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
     :around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
     :center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
#0252:A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
     :five feet above your head.
#0254:You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
#0255:Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
#0256:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
     :fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
     :I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
#0259:You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:
     :
     :	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."
     :
     :The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
     :mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
     :hideous fate, can be heard.
#0266:The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
     :attempts to pass.
#0268:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
     :cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
     :are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
#0271:You are not equipped for an exorcism.
#0272:There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
     :cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
     :of a greater power, flee through the walls.
#0275:You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
     :room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
     :sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
     :the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
     :adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
     :is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
#0281:Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
     :tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
#0283:You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
     :quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
     :to the north, south, east, and down.
#0286:The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
     :be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
     :the lake.
#0289:It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
     :the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing downstream
     :through the gates.
#0292:There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
     :panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
#0294:The green bubble is glowing.
#0295:The water level is now up to your ankles.
#0296:The water level is now up to your shins.
#0297:The water level is now up to your knees.
#0298:The water level is now up to your hips.
#0299:The water level is now up to your waist.
#0300:The water level is now up to your chest.
#0301:The water level is now up to your neck.
#0302:The water level is now over your head.
#0303:The water level is now high in your lungs.
#0304:The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
#0305:I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
#0306:You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
     :Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
#0308:The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
     :suddenly vanish.
#0310:Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
#0311:Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
     :smart thing to do, apparently.
#0313:You seem to be digging a hole here.
#0314:The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
#0315:You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
#0316:You can see a small statue in the sand.
#0317:The wall collapses, smothering you.
#0318:There is nothing to dig into here.
#0319:You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
#0320:You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
#0321:You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
#0322:This is getting you nowhere.
#0323:You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
     :drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
     :There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
#0326:A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
#0327:A solid rainbow spans the falls.
#0328:According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
     :fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
     :of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
     :out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
#0332:You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
     :volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
     :below to the floor.
#0335:The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
#0336:There is a small door to the south.
#0337:You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
     :for an exit on the north side.
#0339:Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
     :the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
     :chipped out of the front of it.
#0342:On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
#0343:You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
     :There are exits to the east and southeast.
#0345:As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
#0346:The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
#0347:The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
#0348:The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
#0349:The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
#0350:The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
     :chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
     :ground.  Fatally.
#0353:The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
#0354:You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
     :that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
     :dungeon has collapsed.
#0357:The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
     :turning you into a pancake.
#0359:The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
     :turning you into a pancake.
#0361:A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
     :"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
     :trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
     :You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
#0365:Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
     :seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
     :voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
     :have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
     :all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
     :He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
     :wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
#0372:Problem reports and suggestions may currently be forwarded to:
     :		https://github.com/LydiaMarieWilliamson/zork-fortran
     :This is subject to future change.
#0375:Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell directions in here.
#0376:The slag turns out to be rather insubstantial and crumbles into dust
     :at your touch.  It must not have been very valuable.
#0378:The lid opens.
#0379:The lid closes.
#0380:Look around.
#0381:You think it isn't?
#0382:I think you've already done that.
#0383:The trophy case is securely fastened to the wall (perhaps to foil any
     :attempt by robbers to remove it).
#0385:The bottle hits the far wall and is decimated.
#0386:The basket is at the other end of the chain.
#0387:A brilliant maneuver destroys the bottle.
#0388:The water splashes on the walls and evaporates immediately.
#0389:The water spills to the floor and evaporates immediately.
#0390:It is not tied to anything.
#0391:There is nothing it can be tied to.
#0392:The rope is already attached.
#0393:The rope drops over the side and comes within ten feet of the floor.
#0394:I see no objects here.
#0395:Although you tied it incorrectly, the rope becomes free.
#0396:The rope drops gently to the floor below.
#0397:The rope is tied to the railing.
#0398:The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
#0399:The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
     :notice an irregularity beneath it.
#0401:The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
#0402:With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
     :With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
#0404:Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
     :to move it again.
#0406:You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
#0407:Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
#0408:The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
     :an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
#0410:Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
     :than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
#0412:There is an explosion nearby.
#0413:The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
#0414:The match has gone out.
#0415:The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
#0416:The lamp is dying.
#0417:The candles grow short.
#0418:The candles are very short.
#0419:The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
#0420:The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
     :the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
#0422:As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
     :of blinding blue light.
#0424:As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
     :overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
     :is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
     :savagely cuts your throat.
#0428:A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
     :of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
     :all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
     :the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
#0432:There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
#0433:There is an ugly person staring at you.
#0434:The mirror is broken into many pieces.
#0435:Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
#0436:You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
     :good luck available.
#0438:Haven't you done enough already?
#0439:The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
     :devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
     :downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
     :there is a passageway leading west.
#0443:The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
     :you in the dark.
#0445:The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
#0446:Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
#0447:burned out ivory torch
#0448:There is a burned out ivory torch here.
#0449:The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
#0450:The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
#0451:The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
#0452:You seem unable to affect these spirits.
#0453:How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
#0454:The book is open to page 569.
#0455:As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
#0456:A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
     :have turned into a pile of dust.
#0458:I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
#0459:One of the matches starts to burn.
#0460:The match is out.
#0461:The tube refuses to accept anything.
#0462:The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
#0463:The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
     :The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
#0465:The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
     :a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
     :gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
#0468:The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
     :put in that drink, anyway?).
#0470:The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
     :your generous gesture.
#0472:The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
#0473:The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
#0474:The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
#0475:The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
#0476:The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
#0477:The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
     :condiments for his upcoming snack.
#0479:The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
#0480:You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
#0481:Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
     :they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
#0483:The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
#0484:The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
#0485:You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
#0486:Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
     :tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
#0488:Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
     :artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
#0490:worthless piece of canvas
#0491:There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
#0492:With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
#0493:The window closes (more easily than it opened).
#0494:The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
#0495:The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
#0496:The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
#0497:You can't do that!
#0498:The grating is locked.
#0499:The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
#0500:The grating opens.
#0501:The grating is unlocked.
#0502:The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
     :into darkness.
#0504:The door swings shut and closes.
#0505:The door is locked from above.
#0506:The door cannot be opened.
#0507:You cannot burn this door.
#0508:The door is invulnerable.
#0509:You cannot damage this door.
#0510:The door is still under warranty.
#0511:The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
     :of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
     :excitement fades.
#0514:The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
#0515:A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
#0516:The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
     :"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
#0518:The lights within the room shut off.
#0519:The lights within the room come on.
#0520:Click.
#0521:There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
     :from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
     :in a pipe).
#0524:The blue button appears to be jammed.
#0525:The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
#0526:The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
#0527:You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
#0528:This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
#0529:Well done.  The boat is repaired.
#0530:There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
#0531:The boat deflates.
#0532:You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
#0533:The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
#0534:Very good.
#0535:The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
#0536:Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
     :walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
#0538:The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
     :precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
     :by water vapor.
#0541:The ballon is fastened to the hook.
#0542:The balloon is not tied to anything.
#0543:The wire falls off the hook.
#0544:The box is imbedded in the wall.
#0545:What do you expect, BOOM?
#0546:The box has no door!
#0547:The box is rusted and will not open.
#0548:The box is not open, chomper!
#0549:The wire starts to burn.
#0550:"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
     :# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
     :of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
     :sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
     :from sight.
#0555:"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
     :the # in his rock hard hands.
#0557:The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
#0558:Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
     :would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
     :prevent this.
#0561:Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
     :your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
     :of your life.
#0564:Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
     :for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
#0566:As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
     :to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
     :into the room.
#0569:As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
     :ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
     :Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
     :crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
#0573:There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
#0574:Nothing seems to happen.
#0575:The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
#0576:The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
#0577:A dull thump is heard in the distance.
#0578:The flask breaks into pieces.
#0579:Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
#0580:Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
     :flask's contents are fatal.
#0582:Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
#0583:The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
     :be clearly visible.
#0585:You can't see through that!
#0586:The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
#0587:The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
#0588:The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
#0589:The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
#0590:The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
#0591:The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
     :from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
     :with blasting cakes.
#0594:You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
#0595:The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
#0596:The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
     :that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
     :more or less demolished.
#0599:The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
     :floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
#0601:How romantic!
#0602:If you must... Poof, you're dead!
#0603:The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
     :earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
     :appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
     :seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
     :to tell the tale.
#0608:There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
     :the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
#0610:The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
#0611:The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
#0612:You notice that the # has burned out, and that
     :the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
#0614:I hope you have more light than from a #.
#0615:I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
     :# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
     :there is still justice in the world.
#0618:Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
     :gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
#0620:There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
#0621:The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
#0622:You won't melt it with a #.
#0623:The bolt can't be turned with your #.
#0624:It seems that a # won't do.
#0625:With a #?
#0626:The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
     :appendage in thanks.
#0628:A #?  Surely you jest.
#0629:He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
     :kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
#0631:You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
#0632:I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
#0633:At your service!
#0634:The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
#0635:Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
#0636:It could very well be too late.
#0637:The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
#0638:Naturally!
#0639:AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
#0640:Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
#0641:Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
#0642:Are you enjoying yourself?
#0643:Wheeeeee!
#0644:Do you expect me to applaud?
#0645:Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
#0646:You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
#0647:It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
#0648:Tough shit, asshole.
#0649:Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
#0650:That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
#0651:I think you are taking this thing for granite.
#0652:Brief descriptions.
#0653:Maximum verbosity.
#0654:No long descriptions.
#0655:You can see:  A #.
#0656:Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
#0657:I don't really see how.
#0658:I think that swimming is best performed in water.
#0659:Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
#0660:Wasn't he an Indian?
#0661:I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
     :barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
     :of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
#0664:Wasn't he a sailor?
#0665:The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
     :by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
#0667:There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
#0668:Well what?
#0669:If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
#0670:Nothing happens.
#0671:I don't really know how to do that.
#0672:Do you wish to leave the game?
#0673:Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
#0674:Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
#0675:Hello.
#0676:Good day.
#0677:Nice weather we've been having lately.
#0678:Goodbye.
#0679:Here, nothing happens.
#0680:Nothing happens here.
#0681:I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
#0682:You seem to be repeating yourself.
#0683:The # bows his head to you in greeting.
#0684:I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
#0685:It is impossible to read in the dark.
#0686:How does one look through a #?
#0687:How can I read a #?
#0688:How, exactly, do I ring that?
#0689:Ding, dong.
#0690:I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
#0691:If you wish, but I can't understand why.
#0692:Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
     :you want to brush them with.
#0694:A nice idea, but with a #?
#0695:Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
     :glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
     :and you die of respiratory failure.
#0698:Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
#0699:Inflating it further would probably burst it.
#0700:How can you inflate that?
#0701:Come on, now!
#0702:The # isn't sleeping.
#0703:This has no effect.
#0704:does not seem to do anything useful
#0705:is not notably useful
#0706:isn't very interesting
#0707:doesn't appear worthwhile
#0708:has no effect
#0709:doesn't do anything
#0710:Kicking a # #.
#0711:Waving a # #.
#0712:Playing in this way with a # #.
#0713:Fiddling with a # #.
#0714:Pushing the # #.
#0715:I don't think so.
#0716:This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
#0717:How can you tie that to anything?
#0718:You can't tie the # to that.
#0719:You could certainly never tie the # with that!
#0720:The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
#0721:Why would you tie up a #?
#0722:You can't turn that.
#0723:You certainly can't turn it with a #.
#0724:Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
#0725:Digging with a # is silly.
#0726:I don't think that anybody is home.
#0727:Why knock on a #?
#0728:It sounds like there is something inside the #.
#0729:The contents of the # spill out.
#0730:I can't get to that to move it.
#0731:You can't move the #.
#0732:You can't turn that on.
#0733:It is already on.
#0734:You can't turn that off.
#0735:It is already off.
#0736:The # is now on.
#0737:The # is now off.
#0738:It is now pitch black.
#0739:You must tell me how to do that to a #.
#0740:The # cannot be opened.
#0741:Opened.
#0742:Opening the # reveals:
#0743:The # cannot be closed.
#0744:It is already open.
#0745:It is already closed.
#0746:Closed.
#0747:There is a # here.
#0748:You are carrying a #.
#0749:It is in the #, which is in the room.
#0750:It is in the #, which you are carrying.
#0751:Time passes...
#0752:The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
#0753:I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
#0754:You are already in the #, cretin!
#0755:You are now in the #.
#0756:You aren't in that!
#0757:You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
     :be fatal.
#0759:You are on your own feet again.
#0760:You can't go there without a vehicle.
#0761:You can't go there in a #.
#0762:I see nothing special about the #.
#0763:It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
#0764:You are in the #.
#0765:The # has died.
#0766:The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
     :the guttural tongue of the trolls.
#0768:The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
     :bloody axe.
#0770:An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
     :of the room are open.
#0772:A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
     :out of the room.
#0774:The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
#0775:The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
#0776:The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
#0777:The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
#0778:The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
#0779:and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
#0780:and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
     :troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
     :not look pleased.
#0783:Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
#0784:You can't take the #.
#0785:Aren't you forgetting something?
#0786:That would be a good trick.
#0787:The # is too big to jump over.
#0788:You should have looked before you leaped.
#0789:I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
#0790:In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
#0791:Geronimo...
#0792:I don't think that the # would agree with you.
#0793:I think you should get that first.
#0794:Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
#0795:How can I drink that?
#0796:I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
#0797:Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
     :this talking.
#0799:The # catches fire.
#0800:Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
#0801:You don't have that.
#0802:The # catches fire and is consumed.
#0803:I don't think you can burn a #.
#0804:It doesn't seem to work.
#0805:Can you unlock a grating with a #?
#0806:Munging a # #.
#0807:Trying to kill a # #.
#0808:Trying to attack a # #.
#0809:There is nothing here to attack.
#0810:I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
#0811:with your bare hands is suicidal
#0812:with that is very self-destructive
#0813:You are in perfect health.
#0814:You have a light wound.
#0815:You have a serious wound.
#0816:You have several wounds.
#0817:You have serious wounds.
#0818:You are at death's door.
#0819:You can be killed by one more light wound.
#0820:You can be killed by a serious wound.
#0821:You can survive one serious wound.
#0822:You are strong enough to take several wounds.
#0823:You have been killed once.
#0824:You have been killed twice.
#0825:This gives you the rank of Cheater.
#0826:This gives you the rank of Wizard.
#0827:This gives you the rank of Master.
#0828:This gives you the rank of Winner.
#0829:This gives you the rank of Hacker.
#0830:This gives you the rank of Adventurer.
#0831:This gives you the rank of Junior Adventurer.
#0832:This gives you the rank of Novice Adventurer.
#0833:This gives you the rank of Amateur Adventurer.
#0834:This gives you the rank of Beginner.
#0835:Your sword is no longer glowing.
#0836:Your sword is glowing with a faint blue glow.
#0837:You sword has begun to glow very brightly.
#0838:Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
     :neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
#0840:The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
     :recovers his stilletto.
#0842:His booty remains.
#0843:As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
     :treasures reappear:  A #.
#0845:  A #.
#0846:There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
     :against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
#0848:There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
     :ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
#0850:The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
     :when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
#0852:Once you got him, what would you do with him?
#0853:You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
     :it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
     :seem angered by your attempt.
#0856:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
#0857:You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
     :but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
#0859:Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
#0860:The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
     :stupid as you are?
#0862:The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
#0863:The candles are not lit.
#0864:The flame is extinguished.
#0865:Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
     :burn.
#0867:With what?
#0868:The candles are lit.
#0869:The candles are already lit.
#0870:You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
#0871:You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
#0872:The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
#0873:Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
#0874:Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
#0875:You can't go that way.
#0876:The # is closed.
#0877:I can't reach that.
#0878:You aren't carrying that.
#0879:Dropped.
#0880:Thrown.
#0881:You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
#0882:The balloon has landed.
#0883:You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
#0884:You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
#0885:The balloon descends.
#0886:You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
#0887:Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
     :causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
#0889:You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
#0890:The balloon ascends.
#0891:You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
     :due to its light load.
#0893:The balloon leaves the ledge.
#0894:You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
#0895:The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
#0896:The cloth bag is draped over the side.
#0897:The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
     :in the receptacle.
#0899:The balloon is tied to the hook.
#0900:I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
#0901:You are tied to the ledge.
#0902:You don't really want to hold a burning #.
#0903:The receptacle is already occupied.
#0904:The # burns inside the receptacle.
#0905:The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
#0906:Not likely.
#0907:An interesting idea, but...
#0908:A valiant attempt.
#0909:You can't be serious.
#0910:Not a prayer.
#0911:You already have it.
#0912:Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
#0913:Taken.
#0914:Nice try.
#0915:I can't do that.
#0916:I can't reach inside.
#0917:How can you do that?
#0918:The # is already in the #.
#0919:It won't fit.
#0920:I can't reach the #.
#0921:The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
#0922:"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
#0923:"My vision is not that good without eyes."
#0924:"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
#0925:ECHO
     :The acoustics of the room change subtly.
#0927:Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
     :sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
     :carcass has disappeared.
#0930:The # contains:
#0931:Your collection of treasures consists of:
#0932:You are carrying:
#0933:The # is carrying:
#0934:By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
     :stop the leak in the dam.
#0936:You are empty handed.
#0937:It is too dark in here to see.
#0938:#:
#0939:I could't find anything.
#0940:I couldn't find any valuables.
#0941:Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
     :walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
     :the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
#0944:Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
     :valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
     :nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
#0947:The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
     :Fortunately, he took nothing.
#0949:A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
     :nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
#0951:A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
     :the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
     :room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
     :others before...".
#0955:The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
     :left disgusted.
#0957:The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
     :have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
#0959:Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
     :fine # is doing here?"
#0961:You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
     :ineffective.
#0963:Attacking a dead # is pointless.
#0964:Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
#0965:The # slowly regains his feet.
#0966:The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
#0967:It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
     :that you are dead.
#0969:Saved.
#0970:I can't access the save file.
#0971:Restored.
#0972:Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
#0973:I don't understand that.
#0974:You cannot talk to that!
#0975:You cannot talk through another person.
#0976:Please input the entire command again.
#0977:Fortunately, you still have a #.
#0978:You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
     :leading up.
#0980:A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
     :adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
     :and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
     :friendly, though he likes people.
#0984:The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
     :think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
     :a cyclops.
#0987:The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
     :His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
#0989:The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
     :blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
#0991:On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
     :now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.
#0993:The bottle is closed.
#0994:The bottle is already full.
#0995:The bottle is now full of water.
#0996:The water slips through your fingers.
#0997:Too many prepositions.
#0998:Too many objects.
#0999:I can't see one here.
#1000:Which one do you mean?
#1001:I can't reach that from inside the #.
#1002:What should I do with the #?
#1003:Huh?
#1004:You must supply a direct object.
#1005:You must supply an indirect object.
#1006:Normally, I would offer to patch you up, but I'm ashamed to say my
     :abilities are not equal to dealing with your present condition.
     :Please let me express my profoundest regrets.
#1009:The thief, being temporarily incapacitated, is unable to acknowledge
     :your greeting with his usual graciousness.
#1011:The thief is taken aback by your unexpected generosity but accepts
     :the # and stops to admire its beauty.
#1013:The # is open, but I can't tell what's beyond it.
#1014:The # is empty.
#1015:I don't know how to look inside a #.
#1016:There is nothing interesting there.
#1017:The implementers are dead;  therefore, they do not respond.
#1018:You can't wind a #.
#1019:You hear in the distance the chirping of a song bird.
#1020:A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence
     :in the vault area of the Bank of Zork has set off all sorts of nasty
     :surprises, several of which seem to have been fatal.  This message
     :brought to you by the Frobozz Magic Alarm Company."
#1024:An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
     :safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
     :forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
     :box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
     :here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
     :askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
#1030:The gnome looks impatient:  "I may have another customer waiting;
     :you'll just have to fend for yourself, I'm afraid."  He disappears,
     :leaving you alone in the bare room.
#1033:Talk about eating rich foods!
#1034:Nothing like having money to burn!
#1035:"I wouldn't put THAT in a safety deposit box," remarks the gnome with
     :disdain, tossing it over his shoulder, where it disappears with an
     :understated "pop".
#1038:The gnome carefully places the # in the
     :deposit box.  "Let me show you the way out," he says, making it clear
     :that he will be pleased to see the last of you.  Then, you are momentarily
     :disoriented, and when you recover, you are back at the Bank Entrance.
#1042:The gnome says, "Well, I never!" and disappears with a snap of his
     :fingers, leaving you alone.
#1044:The gnome appears increasingly impatient.
#1045:There is an unpleasant grinding noise from inside the canary.
#1046:The canary chirps blithely, if somewhat tinnily, for a short time.
#1047:The canary chirps, slightly off key, an aria from a forgotten opera.
     :From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
     :limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
     :a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
     :of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
     :down, the song bird flies away.
#1053:The cliff is too steep for climbing.
#1054:The egg is already open.
#1055:There is no obvious way to open the egg.
#1056:I doubt you could do that without damaging it.
#1057:The egg is now open, but the clumsiness of your attempt has
     :seriously diminished its esthetic appeal.
#1059:The concept of using a # is certainly original.
#1060:Not to say that using a # isn't original either...
#1061:You rather indelicate handling of the egg has caused it some damage.
     :The egg is now open.
#1063:Climbing the walls is of no avail.
#1064:Bizarre!
#1065:The egg falls to the ground and is seriously damaged.
#1066:The # falls to the ground.
#1067:You are about ten feet above the ground nestled among some large
     :branches.  The nearest branch above you is beyond your reach.
#1069:On the ground below you can see:
#1070:I can't see any wall here.
#1071:That cannot be turned.
#1072:You would be lost without me.
#1073:You don't have the #.
#1074:The song bird is not here, but it is probably nearby.
#1075:I can't see any song bird here.
#1076:You feel somewhat disoriented as you pass through...
#1077:You hit your head against the # as you attempt this feat.
#1078:You can't go more than part way through the curtain.
#1079:That would involve quite a contortion!
#1080:You are in it, turkey!
#1081:As you try, your hand seems to go through it.
#1082:The # goes through it.
#1083:The # passes through the wall and vanishes.
#1084:The curtain dims slightly as the # passes through.
#1085:I can't do that with everything at once.
#1086:There is a wall there.
#1087:There is no way up.
#1088:There is no way down.
#1089:You are in part of the long hallway.  The east and west walls are
     :dressed stone.  In the center of the hall is a shallow stone channel.
     :In the center of the room the channel widens into a large hole around
     :which is engraved a compass rose.
#1093:Somewhat to the south, identical stone statues face each other from
     :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
     :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
     :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
     :around formidable bludgeons.
#1098:Somewhat to the north, identical stone statues face each other from
     :pedestals on opposite sides of the corridor.  The statues represent
     :Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are
     :portrayed as heavily armored warriors standing at ease, hands clasped
     :around formidable bludgeons.
#1103:A passage enters from the south.
#1104:The Guardians awake and, in perfect unison, destroy you with
     :their stone bludgeons.  Satisfied, they resume their posts.
#1106:To the north and south are large hallways.
#1107:To the north is a large hallway.
#1108:You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
     :complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
     :is open.
     :   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
     :carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
     :is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
     :half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
     :opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
     :black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
     :the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
     :   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
     :deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
     :exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
     :depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
     :area is a compass rose.
     :   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
     :is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
     :in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
     :in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
     :(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
     :pole.
     :   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
#1130:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
     :the stone floor.
#1132:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
     :dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
#1134:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been lifted
     :out of a hole carved in the stone floor.  There is evidently enough
     :friction to keep the pole from dropping back down.
#1137:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
     :dropped into the stone channel incised in the floor.
#1139:foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is positioned
     :above the stone channel in the floor.
#1141:   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
     :through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
     :bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
     :attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
     :T-bar are pointing #.

#1154:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
     :and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
     :end, inches above the floor.
#1157:You are in a small room, with narrow passages exiting to the north
     :and south.  A narrow red beam of light crosses the room at the north
     :end, inches above the floor.  The beam is stopped halfway across the
     :room by a # lying on the floor.
#1161:Though large and esthetically pleasing, the crypt is empty;  the
     :sarcophagi, bodies, and rich treasures to be expected in a tomb of
     :this magnificence are missing.  Inscribed on the wall is the motto of
     :the implementers, "Feel Free".  There is a door leading out of the
     :crypt to the south.  The door is #.
#1166:You are in an east-west corridor which turns north at its eastern
     :and western ends.  The walls of the corridor are marble.  An
     :additional passage leads south at the center of the corridor.
#1169:In the center of the north wall of the passage is a bronze door
     :which is #.
#1171:You are in a narrow north-south corridor.  At the south end is a door
     :and at the north end is an east-west corridor.  The door is #.
#1173:You are in a north-south hallway which ends in a large wooden door.
#1174:The wooden door has a barred panel in it at about head height.  The
     :panel is #, and the door is #.
#1176:You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
     :parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
     :towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
     :ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
     :window barred with iron.  The door is #.
#1181:You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
     :parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
     :smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
     :bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
     :is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
     :two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
     :so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
     :   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
     :an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
     :of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
     :to the number "#".

#1193:two
#1194:three
#1195:four
#1196:five
#1197:six
#1198:seven

#1200:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see only the flames
     :and smoke from the pit out of the small window in the closed door
     :in front of you.
#1203:You are in a featureless prison cell.  You can see the east-west
     :corridor outside the open wooden door in front of you.
#1205:Behind you is a bronze door which seems to be #.
#1206:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
     :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
     :its small window.
#1209:You are in a featureless prison cell.  Its wooden door is securely
     :fastened, and you can see only the flames and smoke of the pit out
     :its small window.  On the other side of the cell is a bronze door
     :which seems to be #.
#1213:   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
     :master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
     :solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
     :your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
     :waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
     :lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
     :You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
     :moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
     :treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
     :and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
#1223:Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
     :disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
     :As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
     :and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
     :Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
     :future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
     :transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
     :	INCANT, <word>
     :and you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying
     :	INCANT, <phrase>
     :Good luck, and choose wisely!"
#1234:The button pops back to its original position.
#1235:The mirror quietly swings shut.
#1236:The pine wall closes quietly.
#1237:The structure shakes slightly but doesn't move.
#1238:The short pole prevents the structure from rotating.
#1239:The movement of the structure alerts the Guardians.
#1240:The arrow on the compass rose now indicates #.
#1241:The structure rocks back and forth slightly but doesn't move.
#1242:The pine wall swings open.
#1243:The pine door opens into the field of view of the Guardians.
#1244:The structure has reached the end of the stone channel and won't
     :budge.
#1246:The structure slides # and stops over another compass rose.
#1247:The structure wobbles # and stops over another compass rose.
#1248:The structure wobbles as it moves, alerting the Guardians.
#1249:The Guardian notices a wooden structure creeping by, and his
     :suspicions are aroused.
#1251:Suddenly, the Guardians realize that someone is trying to sneak by
     :them in the structure.  They awake and, in perfect unison, hammer
     :the box and its contents (including you) to a pulp.  Satisfied, they
     :resume their posts.
#1255:A Guardian notices the open side of the structure, and his suspicions
     :are aroused.
#1257:Attacking the Guardians is about as futile as attacking a stone wall.
     :Unfortunately for you, your futile blow attracts their attention, and
     :they manage to dispatch you effortlessly.
#1260:The statues are impassive.
#1261:The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
     :blow and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
     :his staff and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
     :completes you crumble into dust.
#1265:"I'm willing to accompany you, but not to ride in your pocket!"
#1266:The pole is now slightly above the floor.
#1267:The pole cannot be raised further.
#1268:The pole cannot be lowered further.
#1269:The pole is lowered into the channel.
#1270:The pole is lowered into the stone hole.
#1271:The pole is already resting on the floor.
#1272:The pole now rests on the stone floor.
#1273:The button becomes depressed.
#1274:The button pops back out.
#1275:The button is already depressed.
#1276:No doubt you have a bottle of moonbeams as well.
#1277:The beam is now interrupted by a # lying on the floor.
#1278:You can't break the beam with a #.
#1279:The # already breaks the beam.
#1280:I see no bronze door here.
#1281:The bronze door opens.
#1282:The bronze door closes.
#1283:On the other side of the door is a narrow passage which opens out
     :into a larger area.
#1285:The door won't budge.
#1286:The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
     :will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
     :panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
     :old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:
     :   "I am the master of the dungeon, whose task it is to insure
     :that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
     :admitted into the secret realms of the dungeon.  To ascertain whether
     :you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
     :Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for
     :one of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
     :discovered the answers during your travels through the dungeon.
     :Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
     :attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
     :admit you to these regions.
     :   "All answers should be in the form 'ANSWER, <answer>'."
#1301:The booming voice asks:
#1302:"From which room can one enter the robber's hideaway without passing
     :through the cyclops room?"
#1304:"Beside the Temple, to which room is it possible to go from the Altar?"
#1305:"What is the absolute minimum specified value of the Zorkmid
     :treasures, in Zorkmids?"
#1307:"What object is of use in determining the function of the iced cakes?"
#1308:"What can be done to the mirror that is useful?"
#1309:"The taking of which object offends the ghosts?"
#1310:"What object in the dungeon is haunted?"
#1311:"In which room is the phrase 'Hello sailor' useful?"
#1312:The door is securely fastened.
#1313:The wooden door opens.

     :says, "That's not a bug, it's a feature!"
     :In the north wall of the room is the Crypt of the Implementers.  It
     :is made of the finest marble and is apparently large enough for four
     :headless corpses.  The crypt is #.  Above the entrance is the
     :cryptic inscription:
     :
     :		"Feel Free".

#1368:The dungeon master says, "You are wrong."  The dungeon master,
     :obviously disappointed in your lack of knowledge, shakes his head
     :and mumbles, "I guess they'll let anyone in the dungeon these days."
     :With that, he departs.
#1372:The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says, "You are indeed a
     :master of lore.  I am proud to be at your service."  The massive
     :wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.

#1407:Sorry, only one incantation to a customer.
#1408:That spell has no obvious effect.
#1409:As the last syllable of your spell fades into silence, darkness
     :envelops you, and the earth shakes.  Then all is quiet.

     :later, a previously unseen sign flashes:
     :	"Unauthorized/Illegal Use of Pass Card -- Card Confiscated"
#1418:The item vanishes into the slot.  A moment later, a previously
     :unseen sign flashes "Garbage In, Garbage Out".  The #,
     :now atomized, spews through the slot.
#1421:I can't see any ladder here.
#1422:Come, come!

#1436:The wall does not budge.
#1437:The wall slides forward and you follow it...
     :The architecture of this region is getting complex, so that further
     :descriptions will be diagrams of the immediate vicinity in a 3x3
     :grid.  The walls here are rock, but of two different types - sandstone
     :and marble.  The following notations will be used:
     :			..  = current position (middle of grid)

#1613:You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded

#1615:You are facing the north side of a white house.  There is no door here,

#1617:You are facing the south side of a white house.  There is no door here,
     :and all the windows are barred.
#1619:You are in the attic.  The only exit is stairs that lead down.
#1620:You are in a small room with passages off in all directions.
     :Bloodstains and deep scratches (perhaps made by an axe) mar the walls.

#1623:Dead end.
#1624:You are in a forest, with trees in all directions around you.
#1625:You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  To the
     :east, there appears to be sunlight.
#1627:You are in a dimly lit forest, with large trees all around.  One
     :particularly large tree with some low branches stands here.
#1629:You are in a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except
     :to the east, where a small clearing may be seen.
#1631:You are in a deep ravine at a crossing with an east-west crawlway.
     :Some stone steps are at the south of the ravine and a steep staircase
     :descends.
#1634:You are in a crawlway with a three foot high ceiling.  Your footing
     :is very unsure here due to the assortment of rocks undefoot.  Passages
     :can be seen in the east, west, and northwest corners of the crawlway.
#1637:You are standing on a path beside a gently flowing stream.  The path
     :travels to the north and the east.
#1639:You are on the gently flowing stream.  The upstream route is too narrow
     :to navigate, and the downstream route is invisible due to twisting
     :walls.  There is a narrow beach to land on.
#1642:You are in a room which looks like an Egyptian tomb.  There is an
     :ascending staircase in the room as well as doors east and south.
#1644:You are in a small chamber behind the remains of the great glacier.
     :To the south and west are small passageways.
#1646:You are in an ancient room, long buried by the reservoir.  There are

     :to the east, south, and northwest.  You can hear the sound of
     :flowing water below.
#1651:You are in a large room with a ceiling which cannot be detected from
     :the ground.  There is a narrow passage from east to west and a stone
     :stairway leading upward.  The room is extremely noisy.  In fact, it
     :is difficult to hear yourself think.
#1655:You are in a small cave with an entrance to the north and a stairway
     :leading down.
#1657:You are in a tiny cave with entrances west and north, and a dark,
     :forbidding staircase leading down.
#1659:You are in a steep and narrow crawlway.  There are two exits nearby to
     :the south and southwest.
#1661:You are in a narrow crawlway.  The crawlway leads from north to south,
     :However, the south passage divides to the south and southwest.
#1663:You are in a cold and damp corridor where a long east-west passageway
     :intersects with a northward path.
#1665:You are in a winding passage.  It seems that there is only an exit
     :on the east end, although the whirring from the round room can be
     :heard faintly to the north.
#1668:You are in a small chamber, which appears to have been part of a
     :coal mine.  On the south wall of the chamber the letters "GRANITE
     :WALL" are etched in the rock.  To the east is a long passage, and
     :there is a steep metal slide twisting downward.  From the appearance
     :of the slide, an attempt to climb up it would be impossible.  To the
     :north is a small opening.
#1674:You are standing at the entrance of what might have been a coal
     :mine.  To the northeast and the northwest are entrances to the mine,
     :and there is another exit on the south end of the room.
#1677:You are in a small room.  Strange squeaky sounds may be hear coming
     :from the passage at the west end.  You may also escape to the south.
#1679:You are in a large room, in the middle of which is a small shaft
     :descending through the floor into darkness below.  To the west and
     :the north are exits from this room.  Constructed over the top of the
     :shaft is a metal framework to which a heavy iron chain is attached.
#1683:You are in a narrow tunnel with large wooden beams running across
     :the ceiling and around the walls.  A path from the south splits into
     :paths running west and northeast.
#1686:You are in a small non-descript room.  However, from the direction
     :of a small descending staircase a foul odor can be detected.  To the
     :east is a narrow path.
#1689:You are in a small room which smells strongly of coal gas.
#1690:You are in a very small room.  In the corner is a rickety wooden
     :ladder, leading downward.  It might be safe to descend.  There is
     :also a staircase leading upward.
#1693:You are in a non-descript part of a coal mine.
#1694:You are in a rather wide room.  On one side is the bottom of a
     :narrow wooden ladder.  To the northeast and the south are passages
     :leaving the room.
#1697:You are in a long and narrow passage, which is cluttered with broken
     :timbers.  A wide passage comes from the north and turns at the
     :southwest corner of the room into a very narrow passageway.
#1700:You are in a small square room which is at the bottom of a long
     :shaft.  To the east is a passageway and to the northeast a very narrow
     :passage.  In the shaft can be seen a heavy iron chain.
#1703:You are in a north-south crawlway;  a passage also goes to the east.
     :There is a hole above, but it provides no opportunities for climbing.
#1705:You are on the west edge of a chasm, the bottom of which cannot be
     :seen.  The east side is sheer rock, providing no exits.  A narrow
     :passage goes west.  The path you are on continues to the north and south.
#1708:You are in a high north-south passage, which forks to the northeast.
#1709:A chasm runs southwest to northeast.  You are on the south edge.  The
     :path exits to the south and to the east.
#1711:You are in a cave.  Passages exit to the south and to the east, but
     :the cave narrows to a crack to the west.  The earth is particularly
     :damp here.
#1714:A chasm, evidently produced by an ancient river, runs through the
     :cave here.  Passages lead off in all directions.
#1716:You have entered a cave with passages leading north and southeast.
#1717:This is a room which is bare on all sides.  There is an exit down.
     :To the east is a great door made of stone.  Above the door, the
     :following words are written:  "No man shall enter this room without
     :solving this riddle--
     :	What is tall as a house,
     :	Round as a cup,
     :	And all the king's horses can't draw it up?".
#1724:This is a former broom closet.  The exits are to the east and west.
#1725:You are standing in a small circular room with a pedestal.  A set of
     :stairs leads up, and passages leave the the east and west.
#1727:You are in the west end of a large temple.  On the south wall is an
     :ancient inscription, probably a prayer in a long-forgotten language.
     :The north wall is solid granite.  The entrance at the west end of the
     :room is through huge marble pillars.
#1731:You are in the east end of a large temple.  In front of you is what
     :appears to be an altar.
#1733:This room appears to have been the waiting room for groups touring
     :the dam.  There are exits here to the north and east marked
     :"PRIVATE", though the doors are open, and an exit to the south.
#1736:You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
     :control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
     :room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
     :the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
     :panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
     :different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this
     :room are in the west and south ends.
#1743:You are in a long passage.  To the south is one entrance.  On the
     :east there is an old wooden door with a large hole in it (about
     :cyclops sized).
#1746:This is a large room, whose north wall is solid granite.  A number
     :of discarded bags, which crumble at your touch, are scattered about
     :on the floor.  There is an exit down and what appears to be a newly
     :created passage to the east.
#1750:You are in what appears to have been an artist's studio.  The walls
     :and floors are splattered with paints of 69 different colors.
     :Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and
     :northwest of the room are open doors (also covered with paint).  An
     :extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
     :you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
     :could get back down.
#1757:You are in an art gallery.  Most of the paintings which were here
     :have been stolen by vandals with exceptional taste.  The vandals
     :left through the north, south, or west exits.
#1760:You are at the base of flood control dam #3, which looms above you
     :and to the north.   The Frigid River is flowing by here.  Across the
     :river are the white cliffs, which seem to form a giant wall stretching
     :from north to south along the east shore of the river as it winds its
     :way downstream.
#1765:You are on the Frigid River in the vicinity of the dam.  The river
     :flows quietly here.  There is a landing on the west shore.
#1767:The river turns a corner here making it impossible to see the
     :dam.  The white cliffs loom on the east bank, and large rocks
     :prevent landing on the west.
#1770:The river descends here into a valley.  There is a narrow beach on
     :the east below the cliffs, and there is some shore on the west which
     :may be suitable.  In the distance a faint rumbling can be heard.
#1773:You are on a narrow strip of beach which runs along the base of the
     :white cliffs.  The only path here is a narrow one, heading south
     :along the cliffs.
#1776:You are on a rocky, narrow strip of beach beside the cliffs.  A
     :narrow path leads north along the shore.
#1778:The river is running faster here, and the sound ahead appears to be
     :that of rushing water.  On the west shore is a sandy beach.  A small
     :area of beach can also be seen below the cliffs.
#1781:The sound of rushing water is nearly unbearable here.  On the west
     :shore is a large landing area.
#1783:You are on the shore of the river.  The river here seems somewhat
     :treacherous.  A path travels from north to south here, the south end
     :quickly turning around a sharp corner.
#1786:You are on a large sandy beach at the shore of the river, which is
     :flowing quickly by.  A path runs beside the river to the south here.
#1788:You are on the west shore of the river.  An entrance to a cave is
     :to the northwest.  The shore is very rocky here.
#1790:You are in a small cave whose exits are on the south and northwest.
#1791:You are in a barrel.  Congratulations.  Etched into the side of the
     :barrel is the word "GERONIMO!".
#1793:You are on top of a rainbow (I bet you never thought you would walk
     :on a rainbow), with a magnificent view of the falls.  The rainbow
     :travels east-west here.
#1796:You are on a small beach on the continuation of the Frigid River
     :past the falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the white
     :cliffs.  The river canyon opens here, and sunlight shines in from
     :above.  A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west, and a narrow path
     :continues to the southeast.
#1801:You are beneath the walls of the river canyon, which may be climbable
     :here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the
     :runoff of Aragain Falls.  To the north is a narrow path.
#1804:You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon.
     :You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists
     :along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the
     :canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears
     :climbable.
#1809:You are at the top of the great canyon on its south wall. From here
     :there is a marvelous view of the canyon and parts of the Frigid River
     :upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the white cliffs still
     :appear to loom far above.  Following the canyon upstream (north and
     :northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
     :Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
     :top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the
     :west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles
     :around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.
#1818:You are at the bottom of a large dormant volcano.  High above you
     :light may be seen entering from the cone of the volcano.  The only
     :exit here is to the north.
#1821:You are about one hundred feet above the bottom of the volcano.  The
     :top of the volcano is clearly visible here.
#1823:You are about two hundred feet above the volcano floor.  Looming
     :above is the rim of the volcano.  There is a small ledge on the
     :west side.
#1826:You are high above the floor of the volcano.  From here the rim of
     :the volcano looks very narrow, and you are quite near it.  To the
     :east is what appears to be a viewing ledge, too thin to land on.
#1829:You are near the rim of the volcano, which is only about fifteen feet
     :across.  To the west, there is a place to land with a wide ledge.
#1831:You are on a narrow ledge overlooking the inside of an old dormant
     :volcano.  This ledge appears to be about in the middle between the
     :floor below and the rim above.  There is an exit here to the south.
#1834:You are on a ledge in the middle of a large volcano.  Below you
     :the volcano bottom can be seen and above is the rim of the volcano.
     :A couple of ledges can be seen on the other side of the volcano;
     :it appears that this ledge is intermediate in elevation between
     :those on the other side.  The exit from this room is to the east.
#1839:You are in a room which must have been a large library, probably
     :for the royal family.  All of the shelves appear to have been gnawed
     :to pieces by unfriendly gnomes.  To the north is an exit.
#1842:You are in a small room, whose walls are formed by an old lava flow.
     :There are exits here to the west and the south.
#1844:You are in a large room full of assorted heavy machinery.  The room
     :smells of burned resistors.  The room is noisy from the whirring
     :sounds of the machines.  Along one wall of the room are three buttons
     :which are, respectively, round, triangular, and square.  Naturally,
     :above the buttons are instructions written in EBCDIC.  A large sign
     :above all the buttons says in English:
     :
     :		    DANGER:  HIGH VOLTAGE
     :
     :There are exits to the west and the south.
#1854:You are in a dingy closet adjacent to the machine room.  On one wall
     :is a small sticker which reads:
     :
     :		Protected by
     :		  FROBOZZ
     :	     Magic Alarm Company
     :	      (Hello, footpad!).
#1861:You are trapped inside an steel cage.
#1862:You are at the top of the well.  Well done.  There are etchings on
     :the side of the well.  There is a small crack across the floor at the
     :entrance to a room on the east, but it can be crossed easily.
#1865:You are in a damp circular room, whose walls are made of brick and
     :mortar.  The roof of this room is not visible, but there appear to be
     :some etchings on the walls.  There is a passageway to the west.
#1868:You are in a small square room, in the center of which is a large
     :oblong table, no doubt set for afternoon tea.  It is clear from the
     :objects on the table that the users were indeed mad.  In the eastern
     :corner of this room is a small hole no more than four inches high.
     :There are passageways leading away to the west and the northwest.
#1873:You are in an enormous room, in the center of which are four wooden
     :posts delineating a rectangular area, above which is what appears to
     :be a wooden roof.  In fact, all objects in this room appear to be
     :abnormally large.  To the east is a passageway.  There is a large
     :chasm on the west and the northwest.
#1878:You are in a large room, one half of which is depressed.  There is a
     :large leak in the ceiling through which brown colored goop is
     :falling.  The only exit from this room is to the west.
#1881:You are in the large entrance hall of the Bank of Zork, the largest
     :banking institution of the Great Underground Empire.  A partial
     :account of its history is in "The Lives of the Twelve Flatheads" with
     :the chapter on J. Pierpont Flathead.  A more detailed history (albeit
     :less objective) may be found in Flathead's outrageous autobiography
     :"I'm Rich and You Aren't - So There!".
     :Most of the furniture has been ravaged by passing scavengers.  All
     :that remains are two signs at the northwest and northeast corners of
     :the room, which say
     :
     :	<-- WEST VIEWING ROOM		EAST VIEWING ROOM -->
#1892:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
     :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
     :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
     :On the west side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
     :
     :		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
#1898:You are in a small square room, which was used by a bank officer
     :whose job it was to retrieve safety deposit boxes for the customer.
     :On the north side of the room is a sign which reads "Viewing Room".
     :On the east side of the room, above an open door, is a sign reading
     :
     :		    BANK PERSONNEL ONLY
#1904:You are in a room used by holders of safety deposit boxes to view
     :their contents.  On the north side of the room is a sign which says
     :
     :   REMAIN HERE WHILE THE BANK OFFICER RETRIEVES YOUR DEPOSIT BOX
     :    WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED, LEAVE THE BOX, AND EXIT TO THE SOUTH
     :     AN ADVANCED PROTECTIVE DEVICE PREVENTS ALL CUSTOMERS FROM
     :      REMOVING ANY SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX FROM THIS VIEWING AREA!
     :               Thank you for banking at the Zork!
#1912:You are in a small bare room with no distinguishing features.  There
     :are no exits from this room.
#1914:You are in the Vault of the Bank of Zork, in which there are no doors.
#1915:You are in a large rectangular room.  The east and west walls here
     :were used for storing safety deposit boxes.  As might be expected,
     :all have been carefully removed by evil persons.  To the east, west,
     :and south of the room are large doorways.  The northern "wall"
     :of the room is a shimmering curtain of light.  In the center of the
     :room is a large stone cube, about 10 feet on a side.  Engraved on
     :the side of the cube is some lettering.
#1922:This room was the office of the Chairman of the Bank of Zork.
     :Like the other rooms here, it has been extensively vandalized.
     :The lone exit is to the north.
#1925:You are standing at the top of a flight of stairs that lead down to
     :a passage below.  Dim light, as from torches, can be seen in the
     :passage.  Behind you the stairs lead into untouched rock.
#1928:You are standing near one end of a long dimly lit hall.  To the
     :south, stone stairs ascend.  To the north, the corridor is illuminated
     :by torches set high in the wall, out of reach.  On one wall
     :is a red button.
#1932:You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
     :widens into larger areas as it turns east at its northern and
     :southern ends.
#1935:You are in a corridor with polished marble walls.  The corridor
     :widens into larger areas as it turns west at its northern and
     :southern ends.
#1938:You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
     :in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
     :contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
     :   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
     :zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
     :   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
     :as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
     :the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
     :other informative and inspiring works.
     :   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
     :Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
     :and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
     :   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
     :certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
     :International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
     :of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.
#1954:You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
     :created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
     :feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  There
     :are exits to the west and south.

#2408:Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.
#2409:The deceased adventurer's useless lantern is here.
#2410:On the floor lies a moby ruby.
#2411:On the shore lies Neptune's own crystal trident.
#2412:Sitting on the pedestal is a flaming torch, made of ivory.
#2413:Lying half buried in the mud is an old trunk, bulging with jewels.
#2414:Lying in the corner of the room is a small brass bell.
#2415:On the alter is a large black book, open to page 569.
#2416:On the two ends of the altar are burning candles.
#2417:A guidebook entitled "FLOOD CONTROL DAM #3" is on the
     :reception desk.
#2419:Fortunately, there is still one chance for you to be a vandal, for on
     :the far wall is a work of unparalleled beauty.
#2421:At the end of the rainbow is a pot of gold.
#2422:A sharp stick, which appears to have been broken at one end, is here.
#2423:On the floor is a gold zorkmid coin (a valuable collector's item).
#2424:The excessively gaudy crown of Lord Dimwit Flathead is here.
#2425:There is a large pile of empty Coke bottles here, evidently produced
     :by the implementers during their long struggle to win totally.
#2427:There is a gigantic pile of line-printer output here.  Although the
     :paper once contained useful information, almost nothing can be
     :distinguished now.
#2430:On the floor sit 200 neatly stacked zorkmid bills.
#2431:A portrait of J. Pierpont Flathead hangs on the wall.
#2432:On the branch is a small birds nest.
#2433:In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels,
     :apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is
     :covered with fine gold inlay and ornamented in lapis lazuli and
     :mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a
     :delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely
     :fragile.
#2439:There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It has ruby
     :eyes and a silver beak.  Through a crystal window below its left
     :wing you can see intricate machinery inside.  It appears to have
     :wound down.
#2443:There is a golden clockwork canary nestled in the egg.  It seems to
     :have recently had a bad experience.  The mountings for its jewel-like
     :eyes are empty, and its silver beak is crumpled.  Through a cracked
     :crystal window below its left wing you can see the remains of
     :intricate machinery.  It is not clear what result winding it would
     :have, as the mainspring appears sprung.
#2449:Nestled inside the niche is an engraved gold card.
#2450:The engravings were incised in the living rock of the cave wall by
     :an unknown hand.  They depict, in symbolic form, the beliefs of the
     :ancient peoples of Zork.  Skillfully interwoven with the bas reliefs
     :are excerpts illustrating the major tenets expounded by the sacred
     :texts of the religion of that time.  Unfortunately, a later age seems
     :to have considered them blasphemous and just as skillfully excised them.
#2456:The prayer is inscribed in an ancient script which is hardly
     :remembered these days, much less understood.  What little of it can
     :be made out seems to be a diatribe against small insects,
     :absent-mindedness, and the picking up and dropping of small objects.  The
     :final verse seems to consign trespassers to the land of the
     :dead.  All evidence indicates that the beliefs of the ancient
     :Zorkers were obscure indeed.
#2463:		Commandment #12592
     :Oh ye who go about saying unto each other:  "Hello sailor":
     :Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
     :Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
     :Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
     :Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
     :Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
     :unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
     :Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.

     :		Flood Control Dam #3
     :
     :  Flood control dam #3 (FCD #3) was constructed in year 783 of the
     :Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
     :Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
     :zorkmids from the central bureaucracy and your own omnipotent local
     :tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive.  This impressive structure
     :is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the
     :center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind
     :the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million
     :square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.
     :
     :  The construction of FCD #3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
     :the dedication.  It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
     :drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
     :tree.  The work was managed by a command team composed of 234
     :bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom could type),
     :12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
     :processors, and nearly one million dead trees.
     :
     :  We will now point out some of the more interesting features of
     :FCD #3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities.

     :2021-10-31					Late Dungeon Edition
     :	(https://www.thezorklibrary.com/history/us_news_dungeon.html)
     :
     :		--- LATE NEWS FLASH!! ---
     :
     :The endgame is here!  (Somewhere)
     :There have been some puzzling new discoveries near the Thief's hideaway.
     :
     :		--- BACKGROUND INFORMATION ---
     :
     :This version of Dungeon for the PDP-11/VAX-11 has been completely
     :reimplemented in FORTRAN-IV from the original MDL sources created
     :at MIT.  The parser in this version is somewhat simpler than the
     :parser in the ARPAnet version;  within this limit, this version
     :is fully congruent with the current version on the ARPAnet.
     :
     :This version was upgraded from FORTRAN-IV to FORTRAN 77 and then
     :later converted C via f77. It was later upgraded to ensure
     :compatibility with Fortran 2018 and re-converted in tandem to C99,
     :also via f77, with the earlier C version upgraded to C99 and brought
     :into line with the more recent version.
     :
     :This version is currently being maintained on GitHub at
     :		https://github.com/LydiaMarieWilliamson/zork-fortran
     :where problems may be reported. This is subject to future change.

     :		      PAPER SHUFFLING!
     :
     :Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says:  "Before I took this course I used
     :to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
     :I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."
     :
     :Mr. MARC had this to say:  "Ten short days ago all I could look
     :forward to was a dead-end job as a engineer.  Now I have a promising
     :future and make really big Zorkmids."
     :
     :MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone, but when
     :you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

#2541:		    Welcome to Dungeon!
     :
     :   Dungeon is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it
     :you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
     :man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained
     :within.
     :
     :   In Dungeon, the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
     :of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
     :vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
     :fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!
     :
     :   No DECsystem should be without one!
     :
     :   Dungeon was created at the Programming Technology Division of the MIT
     :Laboratory for Computer Science by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce
     :Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the Adventure game of
     :Crowther and Woods, and the Dungeons and Dragons game of Gygax
     :and Arneson.  The original version was written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).
     :The current version was translated from MDL into FORTRAN IV by
     :a somewhat paranoid DEC engineer who prefers to remain anonymous,
     :and was later translated to C and then updated to C99.

#2734:The paper is rather worn;  although the writing is barely legible
     :(the author probably had only a used pencil), it is a very elegant

     :To Whom It May Concern:
     :
     :   I regret to report that the rumours regarding treasure contained
     :in the chamber to which this passage leads have no basis in fact.
     :Should you nevertheless be sufficiently foolhardy to enter, it will
     :be quite impossible for you to exit.
     :
     :				Sincerely yours,
     :				The Thief
